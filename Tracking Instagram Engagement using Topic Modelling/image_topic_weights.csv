Decades of wildland management that focused on fire suppression have played a hand in the increasing wildfire devastation we’re seeing, including California’s deadliest wildfire on record last year.

Nero, emperor of ancient Rome, was known for killing two of his wives, allegedly killing his mother, crucifying Christians, and ordering the stoic philosopher Seneca to commit suicide. Nero was emperor when Rome burned in 64 C.E. His legacy lives on in the ambitious architectures he built, such as the Colosseum and his palace, the Domus Aurea (Golden House). It is thought that Villa Oplontis was owned by Nero and used as his second wife’s residence; its colorful frescoes have been remarkably preserved. Some say he was an avant-garde artist and visionary, his brutality simply a product of his time. Other historians define him by his obsession with popularity, and his desire for a godlike authority. Known as a public relations master, he embraced spectacle and performance on a grand scale.

After witnessing the enormity of what occurred on December 26, 2004, I was extremely affected. Having documented for decades the effects of war, conflict, and human indifference to why we can’t get along, there is always “someone to blame“ in these situations. With natural disasters that have occurred throughout Earth’s existence, when I asked those who survived how they felt or what could have been done, their universal response was “Who should I blame, God?” This reality deeply affected me, and I needed to understand how both the Earth, and humanity, heals. So began this multiyear, multidecade project of revisiting the exact spots where the earth had done its natural movements.

Upon returning one year later, the changes were profound, as seen here in the second photo. Returning four years later, I could barely find signs that a massive wall of water, more than 100 feet high, had ever existed. Thousands of new people had taken up residence, trees and plants had grown again in abundance. The landscape and those who now inhabited this area of Sumatra have changed.

Living in the pelagic zone (open ocean), oceanic whitetips are shaped like aircrafts, with long pectoral fins that allow them to glide efficiently over long distances, expending little energy. 
In 2006, I led a trip to Cat Island in The Bahamas, where we discovered a population of this species in one of the few locations left where these animals predictably can be found. Oceanic whitetip populations have been decimated due to the demand for their fins, which are prized for shark fin soup. Like the American bison, an animal that was once abundant and then hunted to the brink, only a fraction of oceanic whitetip shark populations remains today. Their numbers declined 93% between 1995 and 2010. Recovery will be difficult, because they reach sexual maturity by age seven and have small litters of pups every one to two years.

This is a favorite horse portrait, made during calving season in Montana. The horse was used by ranch hands watching over first-calf heifers in a nearby pasture. When a heifer seemed ready to give birth, a cowboy would drive her into a fenced area; when the calf dropped, he’d bring it into the calving barn with a sled, tied by rope to the cowboy’s saddle. This horse was left waiting to be used, standing outside the shed where the cowboys would warm themselves and drink endless cups of coffee.

This is an upside-down jellyfish (scientific name: Cassiopea xamachana). These jellyfish are usually found resting on the shallow ocean floor with their frilly oral arms facing up. They have a symbiotic relationship with the algae that live in their tissues. By exposing their underside to the sun, the jellyfish allow the algae to photosynthesize. The jellyfish live off the food that the algae produces as well as eat plankton. This is a similar relationship to zooxanthellae found in the tissues of coral.

Like other mambas, the venom of the Jameson's mamba is highly neurotoxic. It also includes cardiotoxins and fasciculins, and may also have hemotoxic and myotoxic components. A bite from Jameson's mamba can be deadly in as little as 30 to 120 minutes without proper medical treatment. Ironically it is the lethal characteristics of snake venom that make it so valuable and sought after for use in medicinal treatments. The toxic components of snake venom have, for example, led to the development of medicine for heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. With a bit of luck, the Jameson’s mamba may soon combat heart disease—and  without hurting the snakes: Just a blood sample from one individual snake in the rain forest, and the snake was free to slither away.

Today there’re in homes and businesses, as wealthy collectors indulge a controversial hobby. 
Known in some circles as the “dinosaur cowboy,” rancher Clayton Phipps (at top) explores part of the Hell Creek formation near his home in Jordan, Montana, with his son Luke. The layers of fossil-rich rock date to the end of the Cretaceous period and contain a valuable record of the world just before the dinosaurs became extinct. Many scientifically important fossils have been found here, including the world’s first identified T. rex, in 1902. In the United States, fossils found on private property usually belong to the landowner, and collectors may strike deals with owners to dig on their land. Phipps says fossils generate the bulk of his income, so when he’s not tending to ranch duties, he works his land in a more lucrative way—scouring it for dinosaur bones. #dinosaur #fossil #extinct #dinosaurs",345,211102,"['Grassland', 'Rock', 'Ecoregion', 'Pasture', 'Grass', 'Hill', 'Rural area', 'Working animal', 'Horse', 'Steppe']",0.08844209736917627,0.006040127455443117,0.03900091542093638,0,0.02419816143810749,0.022910617291927338,0.9297651052474976,0.023126110434532166,0

Often, when these women climb outdoors, local boys will throw stones at them, and many of them have been threatened by their own family members for participating in the sport. 
In 2018 Ascend’s team attempted the unthinkable: to climb and summit the highest peak in Afghanistan, Mount Noshaq (24,580 feet), which had never been climbed by an Afghan woman. Hanifa, shown in the following photos, became her nation’s first woman to complete the historic feat.

Hussein and Suaad Ahmad live in Doha, Qatar — their new home after fleeing Raqqa, Syria and the chaos and violence of the Syrian war. They have six adult children who have ended up scattered across Europe and the Middle East as their family tried to find ways to rebuild their lives. The Ahmads are comparatively lucky — their nuclear family all escaped Syria safely — but I could feel very viscerally just how stressful it was for both of them to not know exactly where all of their children were in the world, and whether they were safe. For more of the Ahmads' story, from France to Qatar to Norway, head to @dzalcman and check out the latest pinned story on my profile.

I arrived on my first assignment in Africa to photograph women in various countries for a book project. My heart was open and I wanted to understand their cultures, which was challenging because my mind was shaped by Western values. 
Over the next couple of months, I lived with families in Ethiopia, Mali, and South Africa. After initial interviews with the women, I found it easier to photograph without a translator and to just to be with them. 
Their lives were not easy. I understood them more deeply as I fell into their patterns and rituals. They worked hard and valued cooperative relationships with other women. They were selfless and shared in common the desire to make their children’s lives better. I was touched by their caring manner and I admired their strength. 
I earned their trust. When photographing people I do not look for our differences, but how we are all the same. @thephotosociety @natgeofineart @natgeoimagecollection #ethiopia #africa #women

They must also learn the social-emotional and life skills necessary to navigate and adapt to a changing world; make decisions about their own lives; and contribute to their communities and the world.

There are many. While we try not to anthropomorphize animals, there are individuals whose determination, dedication, and apparent kindness—even in the face of dire circumstances—speak volumes. One such female is a lioness in the Okavango known as Fekeetsa, a name that translates to ""overpower"" or ""overcome"" because of the odds that she faced. 
Perhaps she resonates particularly with me because I spent so much time with her after Dereck Joubert and I had been badly injured by a buffalo. We learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. Fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. It should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn't going to give up on them. 
Despite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn't have to chase them. Every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. Gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. At the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. 
Today Fekeetsa's cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again. She has shown a spirit that I have seen in many women over the years—a knowledge that the responsibility lies with her and the complete refusal to accept failure.

""It’s not even in their subconscious. A lot of people don’t even consider guiding in the polar regions an option as a woman—and leading is a whole other story. You imagine Shackleton or Scott or Franklin. We keep hearing their names again and again. And we don’t even hear about the women.” Follow me @acacia.johnson for more stories from Antarctica and beyond. #antarctica #womeninantarctica #polar

This traditional blanket toss was held at Point Hope, Alaska’s annual whaling feast celebration in 2015. 
For the people of Point Hope, nothing is more important than the bowhead whale. Their calendar year revolves around whaling, hunting, fishing, and gathering, a lifestyle Alaskans call subsistence, which is as much cultural tradition as dietary and economic necessity. This tradition is at risk as a result of climate change. Erosion and thawing permafrost are destroying ice cellars that store the meat while at the same time eating up the landscape, making travel and hunting increasingly dangerous on the fragile, shifting ground.

Marta, a survivor of assault, sits with her husband, Apolinar, in their home. Marta describes Apolinar’s support as instrumental to her healing.

Marta is part of the Malaya Lolas, a group of grandmothers in the Philippines who were collectively assaulted more than seven decades ago in a mass rape during the Second World War. In the absence of working structures to seek support and reparations, they came together, formed friendships, and rebuilt their town, which was reduced to ashes. ""We aren’t strong enough to protest in the streets anymore,"" one of the grandmothers told me. ""But we want to tell our story."" I worked on this story more than a decade after my own grandmother told me about her trauma from the war. She cannot form sentences anymore, but it felt necessary to try to recall what she wanted to impart. These grandmothers—and my own—showed me that the stories we are told are living histories that we all have a part to play in writing.

They say blind dogs see with their hearts, and I believe it. Mace, Miss Margaret, and Ray see just fine in their own way. How people see them is an issue when it comes to adopting dogs like them. They just need someone to believe in them.⁣⁣

My grandmother only had one eye. Few people knew this, including me.⁣⁣

In the late 1940s she and my grandfather operated a diner. They routinely took in, fed, and helped those less fortunate souls who came in. Many were broken in some way, physically or psychologically, from a World War that had just ended. My grandparents never turned anyone away. ⁣⁣

Caesar stands out in a crowd.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
He's tall with striking good looks and impeccable manners, and he is formally attired at all times. Yet Caesar is never overdressed; like a canine James Bond in a tuxedo, he always looks fashionable whether attending a posh dinner party or being chased through a Moroccan desert by villains on motorcycles.⁣⁣

He's a six-year-old Great Dane operating from an altitude that is well above sea level, yet he remains a gentle, humble, down-to-earth kind of guy.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
There is certainly a dog for everybody, but not everybody is for every dog. That blue bandage healing up the sizable tail on Caesar is all that remains of his former relationship with living conditions that were too small for a dog of his size and intellect.

Cooper is short a leg but missing nothing in life.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Once upon a time he was a shelter dog, and fortunately that time has passed. Cooper is now a liveaboard on a sailboat where he serves as first mate. He is passionate about water and marine life, and he’s always on the lookout for dolphins. He does not like cats but rarely sees them when he is at sail. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
He's a seven-year-old Rhodesian ridgeback mixed with miniature American shepherd and Labrador retriever and is known for his party tricks and leadership.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In my years as an animal photographer, I've found that many dogs like music, yet few take the time to learn the lyrics to a song as Cooper has. In the studio we found ourselves in a lively duet to the hit song “Who Let the Dogs Out.” Cooper can be seen in the last image answering with the familiar refrain, ""Woof, woof, woof, woof.""⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I fall in love with other people's dogs nearly every day. Cooper is one that got away.⁣⁣

Charlie is a 12-year-old blend of bulldog, Lhasa apso, Maltese, overbite, and maybe part Honey Badger.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
He's a good, durable, working-class dog who was neglected and left at a shelter just two months ago. No one would have heard from him again had it not been for the kindness of the strangers who rescued him, medically cared for him, and placed him in a foster home.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Charlie would be a great motivational speaker detailing the rags-to-riches story that brought him here today. You can imagine him pacing around doing a TED Talk with self-deprecating humor and a personal call to action about adoption. Some worry this would all go to his head, but I doubt it.

Dogs were the first domesticated animals, running around with humans over the last 20,000 to 40,000 years. It's doubtful that there were animal shelters back then, but dogs have had our collective backs along the evolutionary trail ever since. ⁣⁣

Diego's a Canary Mastiff. He's wise beyond his 12 years and may be immortal, like some sort of half-human, half-dog mythical animal that possesses magical powers and speaking abilities. Legions follow him and graciously offer whole roasted supermarket chickens as peace offerings. ⁣⁣

Echo is an engaging nine-year-old who was born deaf but is a great listener. You can talk about anything with her and she understands perfectly. Echo will look you straight in the eye and make you feel good about your ideas, no matter how bad they might sound. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
When I was nine, I pretended to hear but did not listen. I feared doctors long enough to let an easily correctable hearing problem affect my friendships, safety, and schoolwork. My mom figured it out when our television caught fire one day. I was sitting just a few inches away from the screen, oblivious and engrossed in smoke with after-school cartoons broadcasting at maximum volume. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In her youth Echo was a wild dog, a rescue who enjoyed eating things she shouldn't have. Then along came an opportunity to work with dogs and other animals as a career counselor. It's a job she's taken to heart over the last eight years as a foster parent and role model to countless rescued puppies, kittens, chicks, and ducklings. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
She's a terrier, full of Boston and bull, who wins people over with her keen sense of humor and clever piglike grunting noises that have earned her the nickname Pig-Dog. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Echo teaches us that we are all unique, have different gifts, and have different ways of saying to the world who we are. Long live Pig-Dog. ⁣⁣

Who doesn’t know the mythical stories about these large birds bringing babies to new parents? In Ancient Egypt, the stork was associated with the soul. Greek and Roman mythology portrays storks as models of parental devotion. In Chinese wisdom, the stork is a symbol of longevity. In Christianity, the stork is linked with purification, and followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual ""pilgrimage"" through Mecca on their migration. 
However, since the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of white storks have chosen to stay on the European continent all year, rather than migrate to Africa in winter. The reason:  the guaranteed, abundant food supply from landfill sites, like this one in Portugal. While it is clear that the stork population has benefited from the large quantities of food, you don’t have to be a scientist to see something is wrong.
Confronting the enormous amount of waste we produce on a daily basis is truly horrifying. Walking through fields of empty bottles, plastic bags, food leftovers, and toys brings me to tears.

Prior to the war, both women used to live in a family house in the suburban village of Opytne, between Donetsk and Avdeevka, in eastern Ukraine. They had to flee when their street became a front line—a powerful explosion buried Lira alive under the wreckage. Altogether the house got three direct artillery hits.
Now they live in Tatiana’s daughter’s apartment in Avdeevka. This apartment was also damaged by shelling and repaired by the women on their own. “My daughter has a real talent! She has fixed it so nicely you could never tell there was a huge hole in this wall,” she proudly tells us. Her husband, Aleksander, chose to rebel against the war’s indignity in his own way: like many people in eastern Ukraine, he refuses to leave his demolished house. He continues living in the basement–the only surviving part–and cultivates the garden. Every day he takes a bike ride through the minefield that separates Opytnoe from Avdeevka to visit his wife. Tatiana prepares him a meal to take back, as he has no kitchen left in the ruins.
Tatiana lost a court hearing over compensation for her house. She felt humiliated by the attitude of the hearing members: “They would ask me questions like, why do I think that my house was shelled? Then they turned to a witness and began interrogating her about what brand of refrigerator I had and how many burners there were on the gas stove. They were talking to us like they assumed we were lying and it was their job to catch us out.” Ukraine’s official position is that Russia is to blame for the war, and so all claims should be addressed across the border.

Being in their presence, he says, awakens “a very spiritual feeling of connection with the history of life."" #fossil #extinct #dinosaurs",2105,326101,"['Living room', 'Room', 'Property', 'Furniture', 'Interior design', 'Home', 'Ceiling', 'Real estate', 'Building', 'House']",0.1366214265813955,0.03685353128610946,0.07676068940422388,1,0.022810224443674088,0.02281949296593666,0.9314826726913452,0.022887587547302246,2

These whales were historically hunted for their oil and spermaceti, a mixture of fat and waxes found in their heads. Spermaceti was used to make candles and cosmetics, among other things. The outlaw of most whaling worldwide has granted these whales some protection, but they are still considered vulnerable and endangered, and there is more that we can do for them. Follow me @PaulNicklen to learn more about the role the sperm whale plays in its ocean environment, as well as how you can make a difference to their survival with @SeaLegacy and me. #ExtinctionEndsHere #Whale #Biology #Funfacts",1522,446307,"['Marine mammal', 'Cetacea', 'grey whale', 'Marine biology', 'Whale', 'Fin', 'Water', 'Humpback whale', 'Sea', 'Ocean']",0.1869822509997298,0.026646591267201234,0.09078085516021266,1,0.02274753339588642,0.9309439063072205,0.023440120741724968,0.022868400439620018,2

Corpses were stored inside without refrigeration. Marina, 37, works as a pharmacist. She has a husband and a ten-year-old son. Shortly before the war, they built a beautiful family house in Marinka, a suburb of the regional capital Donetsk. When Donetsk was taken over by separatist forces, Marina’s neighborhood became the front line. It’s been five years since then, and the family still has no access to the house, even just to take a look. Soldiers at the checkpoint in the middle of their street will not let them through.
Condolences aside, this situation leaves Marina with no chance of compensation. The Ukrainian state and international humanitarian organizations operating in the area both rely on the same procedure: a destroyed housing site first must be inspected by a special commission. No access to the site, no aid. Ironically, this approach excludes precisely those who suffered most by losing any chance to return home. In the government-controlled part of the Donetsk region alone, over a thousand apartment buildings and 12,000 private houses were damaged or destroyed during the war. Half of them remain unrepaired, and their inhabitants are at best displaced like Marina, at worst, homeless.

You could be a wildlife photographer for twenty years and never be prepared for what it's like to walk up to a dying sea otter, wheezing its last breaths. Beginning in 2013, a body of warm water, nicknamed ""the blob,"" formed in the Gulf of Alaska. It morphed and it grew and it stretched all the way to Mexico, until it covered 3.5 million square miles, feeding toxic algae blooms that devastated marine life on the North Pacific coast for years. In 2015, some 300 sea otters were found dead or dying on beaches in Homer, Alaska. I will never forget the sounds they made. Warming water temperatures worldwide are a symptom of the climate crisis—the blob was like a fever. The American government recently announced that it intends to change the Endangered Species Act, making it easier to remove endangered species, like the sea otter, from the list. It also pits the value of protecting species up against the cost of losing revenue from industry. Research tells us that extreme events like the blob will become more common; if we continue to put industry and profit first, things will only get worse.

On the Greek Island of Lesbos, self-harm and attempted suicide rates among refugees are alarmingly high, especially with children. In July and August, 73 children were referred to @DoctorsWithoutBorders (MSF) mental health teams; three had attempted to kill themselves, and 17 were self-harming. Ten of the 73 children were under the age of six. MSF has been calling for their emergency evacuation. Declan Barry of MSF said: ""These children come from countries that are at war, where they have experienced extreme levels of violence and trauma. Rather than receiving care and protection in Europe, they are instead subjected to ongoing fear, stress and episodes of further violence.""

In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities among children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys had the same function; for example, protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have.

As I spent time in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge documenting the porcupine caribou herd earlier this summer, the first polar bears arrived on the coast. The loss of sea ice forced them to land in early July. Since then, many more polar bears have come ashore. As the bears are waiting for the Arctic Ocean to freeze over, the fight to protect Alaska’s refuge continues in Washington D.C.: The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to restore the decades-long ban on oil drilling. The drilling was authorized under the 2017 tax cut signed into law by President Trump. In the meantime, the Interior Department released its final environmental impact statement on drilling in the refuge, with the aim to allow leasing of the entire coastal plain.

Humpback moms invest a great deal in their offspring, with a gestation period that lasts about a year. During the first year of the calf’s life, mom teaches it the things it will need to know in order to survive. Research shows that humpback mothers even whisper to their calves in places where predators might otherwise hear them.

The villagers of Sanjou live on the edge of Pendjari National Park, and they are permitted to engage in this fishing festival for only three days every three years. All the villagers bring nets and baskets, and within moments it’s a mud-soaked frenzy, with over 3,000 people in the water. Fishing camps are banned within the park and in border areas, as they often become poaching camps. Fish populations also desperately need
to recover from unrelenting commercial operations. The park employs locals for all its work as a means of compensation, and there seems to be understanding as a result. Pendjari anchors the transnational West-Arly–Pendjari reserve, which covers 35,000 square kilometers. This is the largest remaining intact ecosystem in West Africa and is still in a state of mismanagement. The nonprofit African Parks hopes to resolve that by initially addressing Pendjari while working alongside the government of Benin, which has invited the group in.

I remember the drive taking two or three days, and we stayed in several line camps scattered out over an awful lot of country.  In those days, I was carrying my own saddle much of the time.  I was not then nor now a horseman, but I could stay on and work off a decent, well-mannered horse.

During 2014-2016, I made five trips at sea to document the plight of migrants and refugees attempting to cross the Mediterranean, an often deadly journey. Thousands of sub-Saharan Africans who had traveled for weeks, sometimes months, to reach the shores of Libya are often tortured and beaten, and thousands perish each year on the journey. 
Migrants were then routinely forced by Libyan traffickers into overcrowded rubber dinghies, meant for short journeys, and sent toward the Italian coast, where they often ended up drifting at sea or drowning as their dinghies sank or engines failed. 
In 2018, the European Commission voted to side with Italy in no longer allowing rescue ships to operate in the Mediterranean.
According to data from UNHCR, two percent of people who attempt the crossing die and an estimated 2,275 migrants perished in the Mediterranean in 2018.

On June 30, 1906, Sid Wilson drove the last stagecoach to leave Tombstone, Arizona, on its final forty-mile round trip to Benson. The railroads had come in 1903 and taken over the mail contracts, and that was the end of the stagecoach. ""I used to drive a six-horse stage for the round trip to Benson and back; took about twelve hours counting time to change horses,"" he told me.
After the stagecoach stopped, Sid was a rodeo cowboy, a big game hunting guide, and gathered wild horses in Arizona and New Mexico.  He'd show old pictures of horses he'd known. ""There's little Gypsy Dog, mother of old Pat,"" he said. ""She was a fine horse."" I met Sid in 1970 in Tombstone while doing a National Geographic essay on the U.S./Mexico border,  published in May 1971.  He was a very interesting old man who still lived in the shadows of his youth. He was still a cowboy.

If ice continues to melt, the planet will warm further, as the dark ocean water absorbs large amounts of solar heat that used to be deflected by the bright white ice. @stevewinterphoto @natgeo @natgeoimagecollection",1865,465295,"['Ice', 'Sky', 'Water', 'Glacial landform', 'Winter', 'Freezing', 'Snow', 'Glacial lake', 'Natural environment', 'Ice cap']",0.19493735585352517,0.03265170349101859,0.09756596443602122,1,0.025331687182188034,0.02375202812254429,0.023962993174791336,0.9269533157348633,2

But the bulls can travel further and often congregate around these waterholes, shaking their massive heads at the antelope and zebras all patiently waiting their turn to drink. #thejoyofelephants #thisismytrophy #kenya",1256,445557,"['Elephant', 'Terrestrial animal', 'Elephants and Mammoths', 'Wildlife', 'African elephant', 'Indian elephant', 'Sky', 'Tusk', 'Nature reserve', 'Wilderness']",0.1866680352508175,0.021989565460975524,0.08786095337691231,1,0.023033328354358673,0.02335977368056774,0.023177411407232285,0.9304294586181641,2

The fact that scientists will create billion-dollar instruments in this sandbox made me reflect on the obvious connection between creativity, science, and play. Learning about the InSight lander in particular, from its shock-absorbing legs to the tiny rockets that stabilize it during landing, was especially fascinating.

The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 240 km (150 mi) east of the Horn of Africa and 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as the ""most alien-looking place on Earth.” In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 species found nowhere else; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more impressive numbers. 
In the foreground, the Socotra desert rose, or bottle tree, can be seen—one of the island's endemic plants. The plant is highly poisonous and unpalatable to livestock, and despite being widespread on the island, is considered vulnerable and therefore included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species.

Water passes through the baleen, but small prey like krill and herring and salmon are caught in the bristles, and then swallowed whole. Baleen whales have narrow throats and do not usually eat larger prey like squids or octopus.

Visit the link in my bio or nationalgeographic.com/animals to learn how new toll roads could block the panther’s path to recovery. I’ve been covering the story of the Florida panther for the past three years using custom-made camera traps through my Path of the Panther project with @insidenatgeo. The Florida panther is the last subpopulation of pumas surviving in the eastern United States. It has persevered because of its ability to live in the hurricane-battered swamps of the southern Everglades, where as few as 20 panthers survived the hunting and persecution that eliminated pumas everywhere east of the Mississippi River. It’s from these Everglades swamps that the panther has staged its recovery, and is beginning to reclaim its historic territory in the northern Everglades and beyond. Panthers need expansive territory. One panther's home range is up to 200 square miles—ten times the size of Manhattan. That makes the Florida panther an umbrella species, which means protecting habitat for one panther helps protect habitat for hundreds of other species. As shown in these photos, a Florida black bear, white egret, American alligator (with a giant salamander in its mouth), and coyote all share the same trails with the panther. To learn more about the different species, how these photos were made, and what happened when Hurricane Irma hit my camera traps a few days after this panther photo was captured, please visit @carltonward.

Lara Cusack, panther veterinarian with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, examines a young male panther killed on Collier Boulevard in Naples, where development continues to sprawl east, cutting further into primary panther habitat. Please see the new National Geographic article by Douglas Main about how new toll roads threaten to block the recovery of the Florida panther. Learn how landscape-scale conservation planning, including wildlife habitat corridors and wildlife crossings at roads, can help reduce habitat fragmentation and road kills. 
In the second photo, a male Florida panther crosses safely beneath Interstate 75 from Picayune Strand State Forest to Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge. This section of I-75 between Naples and Miami cuts through millions of acres of public land and primary panther habitat, including Big Cypress National Preserve. Thanks to cross fencing and more than 30 wildlife underpasses, there are rarely panthers or other large wildlife killed on the highway. The lesson is that wildlife crossings work very well, and all new roads through the  wildlife corridors should have them.

Textile waste has a huge impact on our planet. The cotton industry produces 10 percent of global carbon emissions worldwide, and uses about 5 percent of all pesticides and 14 percent of insecticides sold globally. The fast fashion industry needs a new way to create circularity around textile waste and reduce the impact in the coming years. Millennials are the biggest clients in this sector, demanding sustainable, durable, and Earth-friendly products instead of status symbols.

This is a massive algae bloom on Lake Erie, one of the five Great Lakes in North America. The boat in the frame, a small research vessel, is intended for scale—the sheer size of the bloom extends for miles upon miles outside the edges of this photo. These lakes collectively make up 84% of North America’s freshwater and 21% of the world's. Seeing pollution on this scale should have us all outraged at the sheer mismanagement of this precious resource. The Great Lakes have long been a place where chemicals, toxic pollutants, pesticides, and metals have been dumped from a large array of industry. These pollutants are flushed into tributary rivers that extend hundreds of miles throughout the Great Lakes Basin and then into the Mississippi River, which exits into the Gulf of Mexico, and the St. Lawrence River, which pours into the Atlantic. Even in small concentrations, many of these toxins have been linked to cancer, birth defects, and immune deficiencies. Although the pollution issue was much greater in the past, it’s still happening even today, and many of these toxins can take thousands of years to break down. The algae seen here is the product of excess phosphors in the water that cause these blooms when the temperatures increase. It’s not toxic to the touch, but if ingested, even through small droplets while swimming, water skiing, etc., it’s enough to make you sick. Illnesses and toxins can include dermatotoxins, hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, and cytotoxins. It’s a sad and serious issue.

In 2018, conservationists, landowners, donors, and the Mozambican government came up with an ambitious plan to add some two million acres to African lions’ range. They identified 24 healthy lions from reserves in South Africa and relocated them to central Mozambique to the Marromeu Game Reserve. In order to keep the genetic mix as wide as possible, the team sourced the lions from various reserves in South Africa and kept them all in a boma in KwaZulu Natal’s Mkhuze Game Reserve for three weeks to complete medical tests. Then they were sedated and put in two private planes for the journey to Mozambique.  Already, 20 cubs have been born since the lions’ release and it is estimated that that the population could grow to as many as 500 within 15 years.

Arctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change. As a result, climate scientists—permafrost experts, in particular—say all signs point to the need for urgent and audacious action. In the far reaches of Siberia, a father and son are doing just that. Permafrost scientist Sergey Zimov and his son Nikita have created Pleistocene Park along the Kolyma river in the northeast of Siberia. The park operates as a nature reserve, research station, and large-scale scientific experiment. The Zimovs believe that they can slow down permafrost thaw by recreating the ecosystem of the Pleistocene era, which was dominated by grasslands and large, grazing animals that helped maintain and fertilize grass. Grasses absorb far less sunlight and heat than trees or tundra. 
To test this theory, they have imported wild horses, like the ones seen here, as well other animals like bison, yaks, and moose. In 2018 the Zimovs joined forces with Harvard University geneticist George Church, who thinks he can clone a woolly mammoth.

In the current issue of National Geographic, I have a story about a family of 10 wolves (six adults, four pups) that I spent more than a month with. The project grew out of my experiences of trying to document the lives of gray wolves in Yellowstone; I never felt I was able to do so because those wolves have a healthy fear of humans. Every wolf pack in Yellowstone has lost a member to hunting, so they have a necessary fear of humans. 
I wanted to tell a story about wolves in a wilderness without competition with humans and to show them for the intelligent, family-driven mammals that they are. Since there is no wolf hunting in this area of Ellesmere Island, wolves view humans in a passive manner, rather than a fearful one. This allows for unparalleled access to their day-to-day lives like nowhere else on Earth. My goal for this story is to remind us that wolves are complex social mammals that exist in nearly the same family structures as humans and engage in many of the same behaviors: play, mourning, social learning, and hunting strategies. 
While wolves around the world are continually vilified and killed at will, here on Ellesmere they live out their lives free from the report of a rifle and the teeth of a trap. They exist as the key apex predators that they are, in turn bringing balance to the ecosystem.

The crater is in fact a thermokarst depression, or permafrost “megaslump.” Found mainly in the Arctic, permafrost is the layer of continuously frozen soil that covers almost 1/4 of the Earth’s surface. Most permafrost areas have been frozen for more than 10,000 years and remain hidden underground. 
The Batagaika Crater, roughly half a mile long and 300 feet deep, is one of the exceptions. The crater started forming in the 1960s after nearby forests were cleared, exposing the permafrost to the sun. When permafrost laced with ice thaws, the ground collapses and forms craters and lakes. To this day the crater continues to grow. The ancient soils of Arctic permafrost, seen in the wall of the crater, hold the organic remains of leaves, grass, and animals that died thousands of years ago, during the Ice Age. All that carbon had been safely bound in frozen earth—until now. 
For nearly two years I've been working on “The Carbon Threat” for @natgeo (link in my bio @katieorlinsky): how Arctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change.

The hoods also helps to keep them calm should the sedative start to wear off. This lion was part of an international transfer of 24 lions from South Africa, the largest lion relocation ever undertaken. After years of civil war in Mozambique, lions were all but lost in the Zambezi Delta region. Just a few decades ago, prides of lions once roamed the game-rich wetlands of the Zambezi Delta. But their numbers were decimated when their prey was overhunted during the drawn-out Mozambican civil wars, which raged from 1977 to 1992. Across Africa, a similar decline is occurring, with wild lion numbers dropping 42 percent in the last two decades, mostly as a result of habitat loss. This translocation has restored this apex predator to its ancestral lands and it is estimated that the population could grow to as many as 500 within 15 years. Already, 20 cubs have been born since the lions’ release.

Odette discovered that the flamingo developed an arthritic condition on both of his feet—one of the reasons he couldn't be released back to the wild as he simply wouldn't survive. She now uses the bird for education purposes within Fundashon Dier en Onderwijs Cariben @fdoccuracao, which is why we also had a x-ray made of his beautiful long neck in addition to his feet. With 19 vertebrae, flamingos actually have fewer neck vertebrae than many other long-necked birds. But having fewer vertebrae doesn’t necessarily mean that the neck is shorter; the bones themselves are longer. They are seen  as a series of angles, rather than as a continuous smooth curve. This allows flamingos to bend their neck backward or downward to clean their feathers or search for food—its neck is vital to filtering food from water, as a flamingo often needs to turn its head upside down in the process.

Maybe we should all be spending a little more time outside. #nature #beauty #wyoming #gratitude #commonground",1105,442215,"['Natural landscape', 'Body of water', 'Nature', 'Sky', 'Water', 'Mountainous landforms', 'River', 'Wilderness', 'Mountain', 'Watercourse']",0.18526788987366433,0.019345915473230856,0.08571470523340424,1,0.024663709104061127,0.9287089705467224,0.023431137204170227,0.023196132853627205,2

The recent establishment of the Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area in northern Canada is a huge conservation win for many reasons. Perhaps most important is the prohibition of human activity in the area. This means no commercial fishing. No mining. No oil or gas development.

Biologists from the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission got the first photos of her in November 2016, and allowed me to set up a camera trap nearby. I got my first photo of the mother in January 2017. When I showed it to David Shindle, head panther biologist for the US Fish & Wildlife Service, he said, ""I've been dreaming about her for 18 years."" I captured this photo with cubs a year later.

The species will never reach sustainable numbers without access to its historic territory in the northern Everglades and beyond.

I made nearly a dozen trips to the rivers of central Kenya before feeling even a nibble from the trout below. But despite an initial lack of success, my excursions created both ease and excitement within me. As I’d walk and cast, and sit and write, I understood that the hooking of fish was but an excuse to explore and observe. To notice the sweet, enveloping scent of angel trumpets as the sun begins to set behind the hills. To watch pairs of black African ducks surf the current as midmorning sun chases out the mist. To once again consider things both bigger and smaller than me. 
And as the fish began to take my flies, I came to know that the river had given me more than I had initially asked for. I’d arrived in search of peace and pastime, a counterweight to the stresses in my life. But as I waded in the eddies, in a cathedral of mist and wood and leaves, I felt connected, as I did on the summer days of my childhood, when sand sharks and puffer fish made my heart beat with curiosity and wonder.

When these images were shot, the Brazilian Amazon had just experienced its worst year on record for forest fires—now 2019 is likely to eclipse that. Maranhão, like so many other states within the Amazon, has been extensively logged, and just a few pockets of original forest remain.

These women are some of the first indigenous Samburu women elephant keepers in  Africa. Traditionally in Kenya women marry young and are meant to care for their children and homes. Although women had never been keepers before, the community has embraced the new program and is excited to hear what these women have accomplished, rushing to them when they return home to learn news of each of the elephants in their care.

What’s happening at Reteti is nothing less than the beginnings of a transformation, not only in the way humans relate to wild animals but also how we relate to one another. This oasis where orphans grow up, learning to be wild so that one day they can rejoin their herds, is a story as much about the elephants as it is about all of humanity. Follow @amivitale and @r.e.s.c.u.e get involved and support their crucial work.

Shaba was rescued in November 2016, when poachers shot her mother dead. She arrived traumatized. It took the team a long time to gain her trust, spending day and night talking, singing, offering seed pods and fresh grass, anything they could think of. Then, one day she finally took a bottle and a strong bond was formed. Today, she is instrumental to the sanctuary. She keeps order, teaches the young ones how to forage and navigate steep paths, and, most incredibly, greets every new orphan at the sanctuary with a heartfelt and emotional hello.

During the week in July that I spent with the Seminole tribe at their Big Cypress Reservation, the cattle from each morning’s first pasture had already reached the pens well before sunrise. That’s when the real work begins. Some calves are sold to market, some are held back to replenish the herds, others are kept to raise as show calves by students in the 4-H club. Here Seminole ranch foremen Andre Jumper and Bobby Yates sort and part cattle. Jumper, once a linebacker for the FSU Seminoles, said that sorting cattle through the hopper (the funnel before the chute) felt like football practice. Bringing cattle to the pens is also the time to get head counts. Ranchers check numbers against the previous count to know how many calves have been lost, in some cases to coyotes, bears, and panthers. There can be tension with wildlife, but without ranches in Florida there would not be enough habitat to support wide-ranging animals like the endangered Florida panther. We as conservationists need to support policies that allow panthers to be assets to ranchers, not just potential liabilities. In rapidly developing Florida, panthers and ranchers are both endangered species. Investing in the land conservation needed to keep the Florida Wildlife Corridor intact is the best hope for preserving ranches and the continued recovery of the panther.

In Galicia, the mariscadoras (fisherwomen) have harvested berberechos (cockles) for generations and generations. Traditionally, the men in this region would spend their days fishing the deep ocean while the women stayed on land, raking the shores for clams and cockles. Berberechos is considered a predominately matriarchal trade, handed down from grandmother to mother to daughter. Throughout various times of the year, these women venture to different parts of the coastline, raking away until they fill their buckets with berberechos. They then rush over to the weighing station to sell their berberechos before the daily quota is met! Conservation efforts have turned cockle collecting into a sort of race; once the daily quota hits its peak, cockles can no longer be traded in or sold.

For a towering, supersized browser, the pressures of survival in landscapes increasingly hemmed in by humans can be especially intense. In fact, studies have shown that giraffes living near dense human settlements have larger home ranges, requiring them to travel greater distances and use up more precious energy to obtain critical resources. Just like a deep channel blocking their path, more and more barriers impact the animals' chances of survival, and they are certainly not alone.

I've been photographing in the Arctic for close to six years, trying to tell stories that put a human face on climate change. For nearly two of those years I've been working on “The Carbon Threat” for @natgeo, online today (link in my bio @katieorlinsky). The article, written by @craigwelch, tackles the urgent subject of permafrost thaw. 
It has been one of the most challenging stories I have ever photographed, a journey that fluctuated from frustrating and disturbing to fascinating and inspiring at a moment's notice.  What is happening to our planet is not easy to swallow, but we must confront it head-on. I hope our article can help the public and policymakers recognize this new, groundbreaking reality and take action. 
Arctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change. Scientists say what was once hundreds of years away could now happen in our lifetime, with permafrost thaw releasing nearly three times more greenhouse gases than expected. In this image, flammable methane, a potent greenhouse gas, bubbles from the thawing permafrost beneath a frozen lake. When you punch a hole through the ice, the gas escapes and can be measured—or set on fire— as a scientist demonstrates here.
Permafrost refers to the layer of continuously frozen soil that covers almost 1/4th of the Earth’s surface, found mostly in the Arctic. Most permafrost areas have been frozen for more than 10,000 years. And trapped inside permafrost are carbon dioxide and methane gas, built up from thousands of years of decomposing organic matter.

These burns are controversial acts against poaching because of the high monetary value of ivory, and while Kenya didn’t expect this to end the poaching, it sent a strong message: Elephants are worth more alive, and Kenya was stepping up its war against those who traffic in wildlife and wildlife products. Why not sell the ivory and use the money for the conservation of these animals? Well, these tusks are mostly from elephants illegally killed for their ivory, which has been confiscated over the years, and Kenya refused to make money from contraband. Also, in the past ivory released for sale ended up fueling the demand, and there was a sudden and extreme rise in elephant poaching, which has cost countries countless more millions than were ever raised from sales. Tanzania lost over half its elephant population in just five years, and Africa lost a whopping third of all elephants. Many people don’t know that elephants are killed for their tusks and believe that they fall out naturally. They don’t. Since this burn, a number of important things have happened. China has banned the sale of ivory, and while there is still illegal trade, prices have fallen dramatically and so has elephant poaching. However, in southern Africa, where the world's last substantial elephant population remains, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe are calling for an end to the ban in trade of raw ivory and are planning to apply for these changes at the next CITES to conference, declaring that the money raised will be used for conservation and anti-poaching. #WorldElephantDay #worthmorealive #saynotoivory #kenyaivoryburn #whenthebuyingstopsthekillingcantoo",971,250198,"['Bonfire', 'Fire', 'Flame', 'Heat', 'Campfire', 'Event', 'Plant']",0.10482153592847612,0.016999894954305123,0.052128551343973525,0,0.3200905919075012,0.03173822909593582,0.6154868602752686,0.032684314996004105,1

You're in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but freezing water and icy desert, and your heart's beating so fast it feels like it's going to bruise the inside of your chest. This elephant seal came barreling toward me in defense of his harem and the entire beach, and this is what it looked like when I used my underwater housing to push him off. I accidentally hit the shutter as I scrambled to get out of his way. Other photographers ask me if they should get in the water with elephant seals in Antarctica during breeding season. The answer is no. It's like getting in the water with hippos. When this male approached me, I was in the shallows, and I made it back to land with my camera still clutched in my hands and without injury. Elephant seals beat up on each other all day long; bulls grab 1,500-pound females in the surf zone and drown them in an attempt to breed.

He flew into a window at the local Hilton hotel and ended up near the swimming pool with a concussion. He was cared for by my cousin, Odette Doest, who is a veterinarian on the island and also runs a wildlife rescue facility. Odette discovered he suffered from a chronic condition on his feet and he had been habituated to people, which made it impossible for her to release the flamingo in the wild. Instead, she made him an ambassador for the Fundashon Dier en Onderwijs Cariben @fdoccuracao, her nonprofit organization for educating locals about the importance of protecting the island’s wildlife. Bob's life has made a dramatic turn, and today it's far from normal: Kids love the pink bird, and he's a rising star and a true ambassador for all flamingos in the Caribbean.

The dominant male of the Tsaro pride at Duba Plains in the Okavango surveys the wide-open landscape from an unusual perch. Duba's lions are known for their swimming prowess—essential in their watery environment and a skill that has made them highly muscular and some of the biggest lions to be found. Recently, we've noticed that these innovative lions are increasingly using trees as a vantage point from which to plan a hunt. The lionesses have become rather good at it. This male did not manage to descend quite as comfortably as he climbed up. Unlike leopards, lions' ankle joints have not evolved to grip branches—and on the way down, he ended up in a highly undignified tumble. This arboreal experiment may not have worked out perfectly for him; however, seeing these lions constantly pushing their hunting strategies in this difficult ecosystem is promising for the future—one that is increasingly precarious in a changing climate and in shrinking habitat. It shows that lions can adapt and learn to use their environment to their advantage. But judging from the fact that there are more statues of lions left in the world than actual lions, we know that we have to do all that we can to help these big cats, no matter how innovative they are. Ten years ago, together with @dereckjoubert and @NatGeo, we set up the Big Cats Initiative as a long-term effort to halt their decline in the wild. To date, this has supported more than 120 innovative projects in 28 countries, all helping big cats and communities thrive.

The slow-flowing Ragati drifts through protected indigenous forest, where a network of paths, used by humans, leopards, elephants, and buffalo, cut through lush vegetation. The Mathioya is a clear, impressive river that rushes through the heartland of Kenyan tea production, between the slopes of the Aberdares Mountains and the glacial peaks of Mount Kenya. Both rivers are home to populations of furtive brown and rainbow trout maintained through the stocking programs of the few nearby fishing clubs and lodges.

For all of our adventures, @natgeo photographers are not fearless as we all fear not coming back with a picture. Nobody wants to fail, especially when your subject is a slow-moving, 13-year-old house cat. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Most of the cats I’ve photographed are big ones like lions and tigers and leopards, and I’m out of practice, having spent the last year or so photographing only dogs for a project of my design called The Year of the Dogs.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
When asked to contribute to #InternationalCatDay, I hesitantly agreed and reached out to a friend of a friend – Boston, a Maine Coon that I know but rarely see, as she’s like a feline Where’s Waldo in a house full of people, dogs, and furniture arrangements. Boston hides in plain sight and only reveals her position at the end of a visit, as if to say “we enjoyed having you, now please leave.” ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Is The Year of the Cats next for me? I’m not sure I can handle the fear. Stay tuned to @vincentjmusi to see how this plays out. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Happy International Cat Day. ⁣⁣

I grabbed my camera and rushed down the hallway, noticing I had accidentally left my 12-24mm wide angle lens mounted on the camera body overnight. Not the best lens for photographing distant polar bears. I’ll just have a quick look outside, I thought. I opened the port-side door to the deck; the cold air hit my face as I scanned the horizon for bears. Nothing. Moments later, I heard a heavy breath at my feet, even before I smelled it. I looked down to see a mother bear had stood up on her hind feet and was taking a good look at my muck boots through the ship's gunnel hole. My photo instincts are much sharper than my survival instincts, and I bent down in front of her and took a few photos before she lost interest, gathered her cubs, and made her way back into the mist.

I hadn't cast a fishing line since the age of 10 or so, when I used bait and lures to fish the Atlantic waters that surrounded the places I lived as a child, first along the coast of New Jersey and, later, in Massachusetts. My mother’s boyfriend at the time taught me the basics. He was a large, avuncular man who’d been an interrogator in the Special Forces, an experience that left him with his own scars. As he affixed lures to his line, he explained that he could handle little more than fishing and taking photographs, the latter his chosen profession after leaving the military. At dusk along the jetties, his hand resting comfortably on the rod, he seemed at ease.

In a contemporary guidebook to the palace and its gardens—William Fordice Mavor's ""New Description of Blenheim""—the extraordinary suggestion is made that the original layout for the planting of the ""Military Oaks"" in the gardens imitated the disposition of the troops at the beginning of the Battle of Blenheim on August 13, 1704. Just think: a battlefield laid out in the heart of England in a massive, leafy reminder of a faraway military conquest! There is little evidence to support Mavor's conjecture, but true or not, people build their own realities, and it's interesting that readers thought it was true. Indeed Mavor's book was wildly successful, despite its turgid prose, and was reprinted 13 times, once even in French.
Over the years, blasted by lightning or simply toppling over in their senescence, the oaks at Blenheim seem like ancient pachyderms or baobabs clinging to the edge of life. Mavor was right to offer these trees as ""moral and impressive lessons""; not as he intended but as metaphors about the great arc of and empire's rise and fall.

For many people living on the Nu, cable crossings like this are the only way to reach the other side. When I was assigned this story, I knew I’d have to get a picture of a cable crossing, but I saved that shot for last, until I traveled the river and studied the crossing locations and found those closest to markets. The first vantage point I chose for photographing the crossings caused a traffic jam for villagers making the return trip. (You can see my first attempt on my feed @fritzphotos.) After spending two hours photographing people pulling themselves across, I had a picture but was unsatisfied. Still, I packed up to leave. Before I got in the car, one last time I scanned the high ridge on the opposite side of the river for anyone that might be approaching. Far above the river I could see a few figures descending the steep trail. A cow was with them. I knew I’d have a picture worth publishing if they crossed with a cow. When they arrived at the cable, Nan Boyi crossed first. Then family members harnessed the cow to the pulley and gave it a strong push. The cow came to a stop halfway on the cable and dangled there above the rushing waters. Nan Boyi zipped back on the cable to mid-river. He wrapped his feet around the pulley and, hand over hand, pulled the cow with him to the other side. I was happy. It was the last picture of my story coverage.

The act of climbing mountains is often misunderstood. It can mean different things to different people. The reason for climbing mountains can be deeply personal and/or about sharing an incredible experience with your climbing partners. For some it becomes a meditation in being present. Life stripped to the basics—movement through the landscape with purpose. At its most raw, it can be about survival.

@conrad_anker has made a career seeking out, exploring, and climbing some of the most remote, unclimbed walls in the world. Beyond his climbing, he has been a mentor to new generations of climbers and also worked to protect the wild landscapes he loves. But at the end of the day, he still loves climbing. Here at minus 20F, he ascends a new 4,000-foot route on Ulvetanna aka the Wolf’s Fang in Antarctica. Ask him why he’d spend a week on a wall in subzero temps and he might not be able to tell you...but he was surely present and enjoying the moment.

Tigers are the most endangered and the largest of the big cats. There may be fewer than 3,600 individuals left in the wild. Scientists believe breeding populations occur in only eight countries, with 40 population strongholds across Asia. My tiger work for @natgeo magazine over the past 20 years has taken me to document them in places as wild as Kaziranga National Park in India and northern Sumatra in Indonesia. I see the same threats facing this iconic species: habitat loss, deforestation, and poaching for an increasing body-part trade in China, Laos, and Vietnam. When the demand for parts from wild and captive tigers stops, so too will the poaching of this beautiful cat.
The homes of the tiger and other big cat species are vitally important to all life on Earth—including us as humans. Forest’s provide up to 50 percent of the oxygen we need to breathe. Grasslands, forests, and mountains provide 75 percent of all freshwater on the planet. Two things that are vital to our existence. So if we can save big cats, we can help save ourselves.

Tradition dictates that during the journey she must not look back. A Samburu legend tells of a young bride who was about to leave her family’s house. Her father gave precise instructions, including not to look back, but the girl was so sad she could not resist a last glance at the home where she had grown up. During the night, the god Nkai, furious with the disobedient girl, decided to punish her. Her body began to swell until it broke through the hut roof, finally turning into a majestic elephant. The Samburu believe that all elephants descend from this girl, and that elephants and the Samburu have blood ties. It's believed that if elephants find a dead man, they place bundles of grass or branches on his grave, and similarly if a Samburu finds a dead elephant, he takes a bundle of green grass, spits on it, and rolls it inside the skull cavity. It's considered a sign of respect and a blessing: the grass is a symbol of peace, and the spit equates to rain, a divine gift in this arid region. It’s traditions like this that we must take time to learn and understand their significance. It’s vital that as we engage with communities, we understand their beliefs.

The BIA chose the site that is now Newtok without input from its future residents. The locations for Newtok and other new permanent villages across Alaska in the 1950s and '60s were chosen for their accessibility to barges for transporting building materials. As early as 1994, the people of Newtok began planning to relocate once again, due to erosion and flooding, and the situation has become urgent as a result of climate change and thawing permafrost.

I’ve been working with writer and surfer Nicola Sebastian, who’s been exploring how the climate crisis affects Philippine waters and those who inhabit it. She writes: 
Here, where the Pasig River meets Manila Bay, much of the megapolis’ trash flows into the Philippine Sea. The Philippines is the third worst plastic polluter in the world; it is also home to more species of marine life than anywhere else on Earth. This part of Manila is one of the most densely populated places on Earth, and coastal communities like this are among the most vulnerable to sea-level rise, storm surges, and other climate-related disasters. From urban riversides to remote fishing villages to bustling coral reefs, life in the Philippine archipelago is deeply interdependent: the survival of all is inextricably intertwined not just with the sea, but also with the worsening climate crisis.

Take a moment and think back to your childhood, the era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips, and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip, in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities between children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys had the same function;  for example, protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have. It was nice to go back to my childhood somehow. | Follow me @gabrielegalimbertiphoto for more photos and stories #toys #play #kids #child #children",617,183793,"['Child', 'Play', 'Room', 'Table', 'Vacation']",0.07700087351978198,0.010802198956546098,0.03728166878184045,0,0.24690183997154236,0.04229314252734184,0.04347942769527435,0.6673255562782288,0

The Gabra, a nomadic tribe of 31,000 people, occupy territory east of Lake Turkana in Kenya, along the edge of the Chalbi Desert, extending to Ethiopia. For the Gabra, living in balance with a trying environment requires that they protect land, animal, and fellow Gabra. Thus, they practice certain food and plant taboos, preserve full-grown trees called ""korma"" (bulls), and revere pregnant women and pregnant animals. As resource managers, they migrate to the highlands during the rainy season to allow the dry-season pasture to replenish its water resources, taking homes, livestock, and all possessions with them. Perhaps most symbolic of the Gabra's identity is the proverb ""a poor man shames us all."" Since mutual support is imperative for their survival as nomads, no Gabra are allowed to go hungry, go without animals, or be refused hospitality or assistance. A person who refuses to help others is labeled ""al baku,"" a stigma that stays affixed to the family for generations. #withbutterfliesandwarriors #northernkenya #kenya #conservation #fightingextinction",1089,303961,"['Rock', 'Hut', 'Landscape', 'Dome']",0.1273457776735047,0.019065793620224796,0.06237778724153676,0,0.845854640007019,0.05041886866092682,0.05359949171543121,0.050126973539590836,1

In a contemporary guidebook to the palace and its gardens— William Fordice Mavor's ""New Description of Blenheim""—the extraordinary suggestion is made that the original garden layout for the ""military oaks"" imitated the disposition of troops at the beginning of the Battle of Blenheim on August 13, 1704. Just think: a battlefield laid out in the heart of England in a massive, leafy reminder of a faraway military conquest! There is little evidence to support Mavor's conjecture, but true or not, people build their own realities and readers thought it was true. Indeed, Mavor's book was wildly successful, despite its turgid prose, being reprinted 13 times, once even in French.
Over the years, blasted by lightning or simply toppling over in their senescence, the oaks at Blenheim seem like ancient pachyderms or baobabs clinging to the edge of life. Mavor was right to offer these trees as ""moral and impressive lessons""—not as he intended but as metaphors about the great arc of  empire's rise and fall.

He walks through this camera trap at Babcock Ranch about once a month, facing the camera only half the time and mostly at night. Once or twice a year I get to see him like this, with some daylight adding depth to the scene (those are water drops on the lens port). I’ve known this panther, through my camera traps, for nearly three years. I’ve seen him heal from battle scars, recover from a limp, and persistently court the first female panther documented north of the Caloosahatchee River since 1973. I also have seen kittens that were probably his. I’ve never seen a panther in this part of Florida with my own eyes. Only through tracks and photos do I get a glimpse into its secretive life. Knowing this dominant male panther is patrolling and defending his territory gives me hope that we can use his story to defend the larger territory of his species from the expanded roads and development that currently target Florida’s last wild places. Rancher Cary Lightsey told me: “The panther is going to have to help us save Florida.” I believe his words; the panther can help inspire a movement to achieve balance for wild Florida and ourselves. I’m going to keep photographing and filming panthers—and the land they represent. And we’re going to use the story to promote new conservation policies that empower landowners seeking alternatives to development.

These giant algae can survive a few seasons attached to underwater rocks before washing away and growing pale as they lose their chlorophyll—a chemical essential to photosynthesis. 
Hunters from Russia began coming to these islands in the 1740s in search of sea otter pelts. In the decades that followed, they killed almost every single animal for its fur. This led to an explosion of the sea urchin population—the sea otter’s target prey. Urchins, in turn, feed on kelp, so their overabundance led to what we now call “urchin barrens,” regions with hardly any kelp at all. As sea otters return to these waters, they bring sea urchin numbers down and urchin barrens have a chance to become kelp forests again.

Since 1549, the cathedral has had the tallest church spire in the United Kingdom, at 404 feet (123 m). Although the spire is the cathedral's most impressive feature, it has proved troublesome. Together with the tower, it added 6,500 tonnes to the weight of the building. Without the addition of buttresses, bracing arches, and anchor irons over succeeding centuries, it would have suffered the fate of spires on other great ecclesiastical buildings (such as Malmesbury Abbey, Lincoln Cathedral, and Chichester Cathedral) and fallen down. Salisbury Cathedral is seen from Harnham Water Meadows, known as Constable's Meadows.

We came upon a lion hunt that appeared to have gone awry. Lions were pursuing a herd of buffalo, but instead of isolating a buffalo to attack, a young male lion found himself surrounded by a herd of very angry buffalo that lashed out at him. For several minutes, we witnessed the incredible power of the buffalo, as they hooked the helpless lion with their horns and tossed him repeatedly into the air.  It was very apparent why buffalo are considered one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. We thought the lion was going to be killed on the spot, but after about ten minutes, the buffalo abandoned him and he staggered to the bushes. It was hard to imagine he would live for long.
At times these scenes were not pleasant to watch, I will admit. Nature can be harsh. But it was real, and it was amazing to witness the cycle of life in a place that is still wild.

The giraffe is the longest-necked animal on the planet. Their necks alone can measure more than seven feet. Amazingly, they have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans (7), but their vertebrae each happen to measure as much as ten inches long. 
This iconic creature is in trouble. It's undergoing what's being termed a silent extinction. Estimates are that giraffe populations across Africa have dropped nearly 30 percent in three decades, plummeting from approximately 155,000 in the late 1980s to about 110,000 today. The continent-wide decline is thought to be caused by habitat loss and fragmentation and poaching, but because there haven't been long-term conservation efforts, it's hard to know exactly what is happening. Scientists are now undertaking major studies to better understand why giraffe are disappearing and what can be done to stop it. Empowering indigenous communities will be crucial to saving these and other emblematic species around the world.

Native American activists and scholars across the country have called for an end to mascots that invoke Indigenous names, epithets, and slurs, but pace of change has been glacial—and there are plenty of pro sports teams in the U.S. that go by many of the same names. According to a 2005 report from the American Psychological Association, ""The use of American Indian mascots as symbols in schools and university athletic programs is particularly troubling because schools are places of learning. These mascots are teaching stereotypical, misleading and too often, insulting images of American Indians. These negative lessons are not just affecting American Indian students; they are sending the wrong message to all students.""

Then I saw a much bigger male bear was coming down the trail. The young bear stayed draped over the lowest branch, still higher than my tree stand, and patiently waited for the the big bear to move on. Then the little bear slid down the tree and scurried away. Four years before, I was hanging in another pine on an adjacent ranch when my friends were hosting a ""bear workshop"" at nearby Archbold Biological Station. This was when we first officially proposed the Florida Wildlife Corridor project, based on bear science and the Florida Ecological Greenways Network. The black bears living on the nearby ranches, and their wide landscape movements illuminated by my friends’ research, showed us how we could save wild Florida. Now more than ever, we need to accelerate the pace of conservation to save the statewide Florida Wildlife Corridor for bears, other wildlife and ourselves.

Within a week his assistant, George Viccars, was dead, and more began dying in the household soon after. As the disease spread, the villagers turned for leadership to their rector, the Rev. William Mompesson, and Puritan minister Thomas Stanley. In an act of tremendous bravery, they decided to quarantine the entire village to prevent further spread of the disease to neighboring communities. The plague in Eyam raged for 14 months and claimed the lives of at least 260, over one-third of the population.

Seen here: The Riley graves, a walled enclosure on the outskirts of Eyam, holds the bodies of Elizabeth Hancock's husband and six children, all of whom died within eight days of each other. Because of the high risk of infecting her neighbors, she had the traumatic task of dragging the bodies from her farmhouse and burying them herself.

European bison were hunted to extinction in the wild in Europe in 1927. However, captive breeding and re-wilding projects have seen the population rise to over 5,000, with more than half living in wild herds. Bison—Europe’s largest land mammal—help to maintain a mosaic of ecologically rich forest and grassland.

By 1890 just a single group of less than 200 individuals was known to have survived the two centuries of slaughter. Conservation measures were introduced in both Mexico and the U.S. in the 1920s, and while recovery was initially slow, by 2010 the global population was estimated at well over 200,000 animals.

An atmospheric puzzle, they are large-scale electrical discharges occurring in clusters above the troposphere, about 50 to 90 kilometers (30–55 miles) high. These discharges occur high above enormous thunderstorm clouds. The video briefly freezes on the sprite moments so you can better see them; therefore, they appear similar to the length of time visible in real life but the time between them is about 100 times faster—otherwise the video would be one hour long in real time. To the naked eye, the sprites are colorless, featureless flashing patches of grey, and most people would miss them. Here I used a fast lens at wide-open aperture and high ISO to reveal them.

As with most people who love the natural environment, I had inhaled a whole creed that shaped how I saw things. Nature was some place not inhabited by human beings, I would tell myself. Nature is “out there”; the great conservationist John Muir regularly used that phrase. Nature is an “other.” It is every place where people are not. This yarn comes to us from stories people have been telling themselves for so long that no one seems to know where, why, and how it originated. Over the course of 40 years as an environmental photographer, though, I’ve realized that things are a lot more complicated than that. Humans and nature are constantly colliding; there is no boundary between the two. Yet we still like to believe that we can separate ourselves from, and even control, nature.

The research, which compared dog and wolf anatomy and behavior, found that the facial anatomy of dogs has changed over thousands of years. Those changes allow dogs to communicate better with humans.
The research team, led by comparative psychologist Juliane Kaminski, included behavioral and anatomical experts in the U.K. and U.S.
According to Kaminski, ""The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves,"" as reported in ScienceDaily.
""The findings suggest that expressive eyebrows in dogs may be a result of humans [sic] unconscious preferences that influenced selection during domestication. When dogs make the movement, it seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them. This would give dogs, that move their eyebrows more, a selection advantage over others and reinforce the 'puppy dog eyes' trait for future generations.""

Despite continuing shrinkage of Kilimanjaro's glaciers, the steep margins of the Kersten Glacier remain impressive: The cliff is approximately 18 m (60 ft) high. The dust bands in the ice absorb more solar radiation than the surrounding, relatively-clean ice, and absorbed energy leads to melting and sublimation. Such stratigraphy is testimony to the complex ice history on Kilimanjaro.

I had the pleasure of working with my friend Damien Mander, founder of the International Anti-Poaching Foundation, for a story on the elite members of Zimbabwe's all-female Akashinga conservation ranger force. This story is published in the June issue of National Geographic magazine, with writing by Lindsay Smith. Here are a few images depicting the women training and then deploying against experienced poachers. Akashinga (meaning the ""Brave Ones"" in the local Shona dialect) is a community-driven conservation model, empowering severely disadvantaged women to restore and manage a network of wilderness areas as an alternative to trophy hunting. According to Damien Mander, many current Western-conceived solutions to conserve wilderness areas struggle to gain traction across the African continent. Predominantly male forces are often hampered by ongoing corruption, nepotism, drunkenness, and occasionally aggression toward local communities. The I.A.P.F, @int.anti.poaching.foundation decided to innovate, using an all-female team to manage an entire nature reserve in Zimbabwe.  In the short time since it has been operating, Akashinga has become a role model for conservation and for rural African women across the continent. #womenempowerment #IWD2019 #Conservation @natgeo #strongwomen⁣ #wildlifecrime",938,204053,"['Soldier', 'Adaptation', 'Marines', 'Mud', 'Army', 'Military']",0.08548888828373263,0.016422143632480127,0.04404884149298113,0,0.03993513062596321,0.035876013338565826,0.6507064700126648,0.27348241209983826,0

The landscape was familiar—mangrove islands that I’d experienced in remnant patches as a kid growing up in Clearwater, or as a teenager fishing in Charlotte Harbor. But the scale of the undeveloped nature in the Ten Thousand Islands was like nothing I’d experienced in my home state. Florida’s southern fringe, from Everglades National Park through Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge, makes up the largest protected mangrove coastline in the Western Hemisphere. The context makes the mangroves even more impressive. If you are camped on an island like Panther Key and watching the sun set over the Gulf of Mexico, you are surrounded by nature in all directions. In front of you and to your left, mangrove islands and wide-open water reach all the way to Mexico and Cuba. Behind you, Everglades National Park (the largest subtropical wilderness reserve in North America) stretches dozens of miles east toward Miami. To your right, the Fakahatchee Strand and Big Cypress National Preserve anchor a wildlife corridor that reaches all the way north to the Everglades' headwaters and beyond. I recently had a chance to return to the Ten Thousand Islands for a photo shoot from a small airplane. My goal was to capture the seemingly infinite labyrinth of the watery landscape, and tap into that feeling of awe that had changed my perception of Florida on my first Everglades camping trip 15 years before.

During the summer of 2004, I worked on my master's in ecology in Svalbard, where I was able to spend time around an Arctic fox den. And even though my window of opportunity was small, it changed my life. 
Arctic foxes mate between February and May, with births taking place from April to July. The young are born and nursed inside complex dens, which provide shelter and protection against predators. After three weeks, the young start leaving the den to explore the surroundings—and luckily I arrived just as six little fur balls had emerged from the den. They spent 30 minutes playing in the midnight sun before they started to get sleepy again and headed back to their den. 
Upon my return to the Netherlands I entered the images in a photography competition, and to my surprise I was the overall winner.

Rizwan, 24 (with Zafinah, 3, and Zeenath, 3 months) was born and raised in the Wadala slum. He met his wife, Sana, at her older sister's wedding. Her family was not very happy about them getting married, because they don't believe in marriage for love. The couple got married anyway. Once it was done, the family had no choice but to accept it. He works directly from home, as a local internet provider for the areas of Wadala and Sewree. He's been doing this job for two years. He used to work at a local cable provider, but as he saw the demand for internet access increasing more and more, he got the idea to start his own business. He currently has 600 customers. Business is good and he wants to expand. Rizwan loves his daughters. At the hospital when they were born, his family were the only ones  who were happy about having girls. Unlike most people where he is from, he feels girls are gifts from God. “Everybody want to have boys. They think they may support you and your family! I would like my older one to become a doctor.

In December 2018, the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (@giraffe_conservation), with the Niger government and other partners, moved eight of these highly threatened giraffes from the Giraffe Zone to Niger's Gadabedji Biosphere Reserve, where they have been absent for more than 50 years. The translocation has been a huge success, and the giraffes are doing well. This is a hopeful story for an animal whose rapidly shrinking numbers are significant cause for concern.

Switzerland–Jason, 39, Juliette, 10, and Lenny, 7. Jason was born in Vevey, Switzerland, a very nice, small city on the eastern shore of Lake Geneva. Since he was 12, he has loved skateboarding and skiing. Around ten years ago, he opened his first skateboard shop. Now he owns two shops, one in Lausanne and one in Geneva. He loves to go skateboarding with his children and they love it too. His son, Lenny, also has a passion for climbing and his daughter, Juliette, for hip-hop dance. Every Wednesday he's off from work, and so he spends the whole day with his children. “During the summer, on hot days like today, we love to take our skateboards and ride from home to this canal, then jump into the water to cool off,” he says. I’ve recently turned 40, and almost every friend around me has become a parent over the last few years. A couple friends and I are the only ones in our group who still don’t have kids of our own. I naturally began to observe how the others were raising their children. I watch them playing together and hear the arguments and the kids’ complaints at mealtimes or at bedtime. I’ve often been the one in charge of the kids when those moments happen. Maybe, just maybe, these things are making me start to want to be a father. That is why I’ve decided to make the relationships between fathers and their children the focus of this photo project. Wherever I am in the world, when I meet a father I ask him to tell me about a special moment he has spent with his children and, when I can, I photograph them together. #father #fathers",597,237599,"['Water', 'Fun', 'Water resources', 'Vacation', 'Bathing', 'Watercourse', 'River', 'Recreation', 'Leisure', 'Stream']",0.09954313030108153,0.010452046640288525,0.04608848010460573,0,0.023234514519572258,0.432798832654953,0.023283351212739944,0.5206832885742188,1

This frothy mess of garbage and ubiquitous single-use plastic is just two miles into Mexico—90 miles shy of the river’s historic terminus at the ocean (we hiked the rest of the delta). The snowmelt that sustains the Colorado River and irrigates the crops of America’s salad bowl no longer completes its journey to the Sea of Cortez. For six million years the river did complete that journey, creating the largest desert estuary in North America, but today the demands for water are too many. Changing climate patterns and repeated drought are all adding to the challenge, making it unlikely that this lifeline of the West, often called the “American Nile,” will reach the sea again anytime soon. While many groups are working to restore some of the delta, there is a lot of work ahead.

But this spring the service announced that it plans to propose removing the gray wolf from the endangered species list and ""return management of the species to the states and tribes."" The Center for Biological Diversity told NPR in March that the proposal will “all but ensure that wolves are not allowed to recover in the Adirondacks, southern Rockies, and elsewhere that scientists have identified suitable habitat.” Meanwhile, Mexican wolves once numbered in the hundreds of thousands in the American Southwest. In 1975, the last seven remaining in the wild were captured and bred to save the species. Today, just 150 exist in the wild, where they’re defined as a ""nonessential experimental population,"" a status that affords them only partial protection. And there are only 44 red wolves left in North Carolina, the only place they exist in the world. Some researchers estimate that they could go extinct within eight years. Wolves do not have a voice.

These amazing animals tragically are among the world’s most illegally trafficked mammals. No one has any real idea how many pangolins are left. The trade is huge, both from a thriving Asian market for their meat in the restaurant trade and their scales in traditional medicine. There is no proven scientific basis for the medical aspect, and there are over one hundred alternatives to pangolin scales in traditional Chinese medicine. Most of those are herbal. Japan and Vietnam also use pangolin scales in their traditional medicine. The conversation should surely be one about alternatives in traditional medicine at a time of such crisis. We were joined on stage by @natashaldaly and @kirstenluce, who discussed their work on controversial captive-wildlife tourism.

In the past, I worked with Jericho on a project combining my photography and his poetry. “There's already pressure in the United States around being black and queer. I think the hardest thing for me is when that pressure comes from inside our communities, when I'm pressured in a certain way about how to be black ... when people want me to be the ‘right kind’ of black,” Jericho said. “They want me to be that good, respectable black, that dignified black that I think people have almost made a stereotype out of, and it has become hugely problematic. I got a lot of that from my family when I was growing up, and I'm getting rid of a lot of it—to this day.” Much of my personal work focuses on vulnerability, reflection, and ways of challenging bias and limited belief systems.

However, a recent study highlights a different kind of conversation—gentle whispers between mother and calf. 
The babies share intimate grunts and little squeaks that can only be heard by their mums. According to the study, they whisper to each other so they won't be overheard by something dangerous; the humpback whale is a gentle and aware creature that can be incredibly accepting of our presence in their own vulnerable environment. 
On World Oceans Day, I wish to highlight these wonderful, complex conversations that all creatures share. Our curiosity toward these majestic animals has aided conservation efforts, and have helped humpback whale conversations to continue.

Each year more than 100 million sharks are killed globally, often for their fins, used in shark fin soup. I made this picture over a decade ago, while working on a @natgeo story about commercial overfishing. Although I had made other photos of sharks being caught and processed, I wasn’t sure these images would resonate with readers. But when I swam along this gill net and framed the scene through my camera’s viewfinder, it struck me as a crucifixion, and I hoped the photo would create empathy for the plight of sharks. As predators, sharks play a vital role in keeping ocean ecosystems healthy. #WorldEnvironmentDay",5255,531996,"['Fish', 'Shark', 'Blue', 'Water', 'Great white shark', 'Lamnidae', 'Cartilaginous fish', 'Lamniformes', 'Marine biology', 'Underwater']",0.2228820287444567,0.09200252109667706,0.14435432415578892,1,0.022835053503513336,0.9314283132553101,0.022931156679987907,0.02280554175376892,3

I hold this subject in high regard, as much of my current work is meant to share the beauty and delicacy of animals and locations around the world. This image of mother and baby shows the gentle nature of elephants, and it saddens me to say that just last week Botswana lifted its elephant hunting ban, which up until now created a sanctuary for these threatened species. It is vital that our society works to protect animals such as elephants, before they disappear from the planet.

Will you drive less, and buy products made sustainably?

Ancient wildlife paths to the vast Mkgadikgadi Pans were blocked by cattle fences in the 1960s, and a massive migration of zebras and wildebeest was lost. Recently, however, a fence was dropped, and despite the fact that no zebra alive would have previously walked this route, the migration was revived. Researchers believe that these important migratory routes are somehow genetically encoded and are working to discover the mechanisms behind it. But this does show us how much we don’t know, and how important historical migratory routes are. This World Environment Day it is certainly worthwhile assessing other fences and the impact (positive or negative) that they may be having. This is especially relevant now, as the Botswana government has announced that it will be closing numerous migratory routes in a bid to curb elephant movement. #WorldEnvironmentDay #makgadikgadi #zebramigration #ancientwildliferoutes #botswana",1057,396629,['Insect'],0.16616943770044346,0.01850554991421268,0.077571105028705,1,0.1250876486301422,0.12508192658424377,0.12508660554885864,0.6247438788414001,2
