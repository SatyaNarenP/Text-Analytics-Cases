Mankind’s autumn harvest rituals have become huge technological spectacles as we struggle to feed our burgeoning world population. Just as important—but harder to see—is what Annie is doing with her soil: She’s using no-till agriculture. By reducing tillage (not plowing and leaving crop residue in place), she can actually help in capturing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it in the soil. For a long time, world agriculture has been depleting soil carbon and releasing it into the atmosphere. Reversing that trend, especially on large-scale farms like Annie’s, could be a big win all around. // @IndigoAg is unlocking agriculture’s potential to help reverse climate change.

You could be a wildlife photographer for twenty years and never be prepared for what it's like to walk up to a dying sea otter, wheezing its last breaths. Beginning in 2013, a body of warm water, nicknamed ""the blob,"" formed in the Gulf of Alaska. It morphed and it grew and it stretched all the way to Mexico, until it covered 3.5 million square miles, feeding toxic algae blooms that devastated marine life on the North Pacific coast for years. In 2015, some 300 sea otters were found dead or dying on beaches in Homer, Alaska. I will never forget the sounds they made. Warming water temperatures worldwide are a symptom of the climate crisis—the blob was like a fever. The American government recently announced that it intends to change the Endangered Species Act, making it easier to remove endangered species, like the sea otter, from the list. It also pits the value of protecting species up against the cost of losing revenue from industry. Research tells us that extreme events like the blob will become more common; if we continue to put industry and profit first, things will only get worse.

Their lives were not easy. I understood them more deeply as I fell into their patterns and rituals. They worked hard and valued cooperative relationships with other women.

I had never seen a sperm whale breach like this before. Compared to orcas or humpback whales, sperm whales aren't as well known for this kind of aerobatic display, but here you can see that they are capable of great agility. They are the largest toothed predators in the world with the largest brains, and their skeletons are designed to handle the immense pressure of their deep ocean dives. A flexible cartilage connects the spine to the ribs, which means the rib cage collapses under heavy pressure instead of snapping. These whales were historically hunted for their oil and spermaceti, a mixture of fat and waxes found in their heads. Spermaceti was used to make candles and cosmetics, among other things. The outlaw of most whaling worldwide has granted these whales some protection, but they are still considered vulnerable and endangered, and there is more that we can do for them.

The recent establishment of the Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area in northern Canada is a huge conservation win for many reasons. Perhaps most important is the prohibition of human activity in the area. This means no commercial fishing. No mining. No oil or gas development.

There are many. While we try not to anthropomorphize animals, there are individuals whose determination, dedication, and apparent kindness—even in the face of dire circumstances—speak volumes. One such female is a lioness in the Okavango known as Fekeetsa, a name that translates to ""overpower"" or ""overcome"" because of the odds that she faced. 
Perhaps she resonates particularly with me because I spent so much time with her after Dereck Joubert and I had been badly injured by a buffalo. We learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. Fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. It should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn't going to give up on them. 
Despite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn't have to chase them. Every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. Gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. At the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. 
Today Fekeetsa's cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again. She has shown a spirit that I have seen in many women over the years—a knowledge that the responsibility lies with her and the complete refusal to accept failure.

The railroads had come in 1903 and taken over the mail contracts, and that was the end of the stagecoach. ""I used to drive a six-horse stage for the round trip to Benson and back; took about twelve hours counting time to change horses,"" he told me.
After the stagecoach stopped, Sid was a rodeo cowboy, a big game hunting guide, and gathered wild horses in Arizona and New Mexico.  He'd show old pictures of horses he'd known.

The crater is in fact a thermokarst depression, or permafrost “megaslump.” Found mainly in the Arctic, permafrost is the layer of continuously frozen soil that covers almost 1/4 of the Earth’s surface. Most permafrost areas have been frozen for more than 10,000 years and remain hidden underground. 
The Batagaika Crater, roughly half a mile long and 300 feet deep, is one of the exceptions. The crater started forming in the 1960s after nearby forests were cleared, exposing the permafrost to the sun. When permafrost laced with ice thaws, the ground collapses and forms craters and lakes. To this day the crater continues to grow. The ancient soils of Arctic permafrost, seen in the wall of the crater, hold the organic remains of leaves, grass, and animals that died thousands of years ago, during the Ice Age. All that carbon had been safely bound in frozen earth—until now. 
For nearly two years I've been working on “The Carbon Threat” for @natgeo (link in my bio @katieorlinsky): how Arctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change. It is perhaps the least understood reason to hasten our transition off fossil fuels. Time is of the essence, and I hope our reporting can help the public and policymakers recognize this new, urgent reality."

Her father taught her and many others to prepare for a four-wave ""hold down""—in case they wipe out in big surf. At 13-second intervals between waves, that could mean being held underwater for one minute, as the heavy waves roll and roar above you. It's one thing to hold your breath in a swimming pool for a minute; it is something completely different to swim down 30 feet, pick up a huge rock, and then run as hard as you can underwater.

The hoods also helps to keep them calm should the sedative start to wear off. This lion was part of an international transfer of 24 lions from South Africa, the largest lion relocation ever undertaken. After years of civil war in Mozambique, lions were all but lost in the Zambezi Delta region. Just a few decades ago, prides of lions once roamed the game-rich wetlands of the Zambezi Delta. But their numbers were decimated when their prey was overhunted during the drawn-out Mozambican civil wars, which raged from 1977 to 1992. Across Africa, a similar decline is occurring, with wild lion numbers dropping 42 percent in the last two decades, mostly as a result of habitat loss. This translocation has restored this apex predator to its ancestral lands and it is estimated that the population could grow to as many as 500 within 15 years. Already, 20 cubs have been born since the lions’ release.

Perhaps that’s why I feel such empathy for the struggles of mothers in the wild. A harp seal mother does everything by herself. She gives birth on the ice where her pup will spend the first weeks of his life, suckling at her side until he is ready, around two weeks later, to slip over the lip of the ice and into the Arctic water. These pups are born without blubber, but they quickly pack it on from their mother's milk, which contains between 25% and 40% fat—the higher the fat content, the closer the pups are to leaving their mother's side. Pups grow from roughly 24 pounds at birth to 80 pounds by the time their mothers leave them to fend for themselves.

Textile waste has a huge impact on our planet. The cotton industry produces 10 percent of global carbon emissions worldwide, and uses about 5 percent of all pesticides and 14 percent of insecticides sold globally. The fast fashion industry needs a new way to create circularity around textile waste and reduce the impact in the coming years.

This is a favorite horse portrait, made during calving season in Montana. The horse was used by ranch hands watching over first-calf heifers in a nearby pasture. When a heifer seemed ready to give birth, a cowboy would drive her into a fenced area; when the calf dropped, he’d bring it into the calving barn with a sled, tied by rope to the cowboy’s saddle.

I fought that label; it seemed like an extra job to do. I felt a burden to be perfect, capable of doing all the things the men could do. 
But I eventually realized that being a woman was the best thing about my life. I was welcomed into the hidden worlds of women that had never been photographed before, especially those at the edge of change, facing cultural dislocation from war, poverty, and human trafficking. I’ve explored the complexities of their lives, searching for the moments that reveal how they prevail or just survive. I’ve found women defiant, triumphant, or simply making the best of it. But the women who’ve inspired and humbled me the most are those enduring the most brutal circumstances and somehow surviving, against all odds. Here, women in debt bondage in India work in the brick kilns, bearing astonishing burdens all day, every day. Follow me @jodicobbphoto for more images of women and the world. #humantrafficking"

She seems to be asking, what are you doing to my home?
A wise man once said, “Where there is life there is hope, but the time to act is now.” We are in danger of losing more than one million species to extinction. And we will suffer greatly,  as we are part of nature and everything on the planet is connected. Nature is perfection.
All of us, and especially young people, need to take back the planet from the ones who care only about the short term. Fifty-plus percent of the biodiversity is found in forests, and each tree produces enough oxygen for 12 people. We all need to work toward a future where we protect 50% of our planet–so we have a future for generations to come. Take a walk in the woods and hear the symphony of nature in the birds and insects or walk on the beach. Nature heals. I have hope; without it, what is left? Believe."

In the four decades that I’ve been exploring the world’s oceans, I have seen more plastic in the sea each year. The devastating impact this has on marine wildlife is substantial and can be seen in many ways. In this case, the turtle likely came close to the drifting basket because floating objects in the ocean often attract marine life below. The basket had a plastic rope handle and the turtle’s flippers became severely entangled, preventing the turtle from swimming or diving. After making this photograph, I was able to free the turtle, and it swam away quickly. // Go to @AmericanExpress to learn more about what American Express is doing to address marine plastic pollution and to discover how you can get involved."

With natural disasters that have occurred throughout Earth’s existence, when I asked those who survived how they felt or what could have been done, their universal response was “Who should I blame, God?” This reality deeply affected me, and I needed to understand how both the Earth, and humanity, heals. So began this multiyear, multidecade project of revisiting the exact spots where the earth had done its natural movements.

Upon returning one year later, the changes were profound, as seen here in the second photo. Returning four years later, I could barely find signs that a massive wall of water, more than 100 feet high, had ever existed. Thousands of new people had taken up residence, trees and plants had grown again in abundance. The landscape and those who now inhabited this area of Sumatra have changed.

In the current issue of National Geographic, I have a story about a family of 10 wolves (six adults, four pups) that I spent more than a month with. The project grew out of my experiences of trying to document the lives of gray wolves in Yellowstone; I never felt I was able to do so because those wolves have a healthy fear of humans. Every wolf pack in Yellowstone has lost a member to hunting, so they have a necessary fear of humans. 
I wanted to tell a story about wolves in a wilderness without competition with humans and to show them for the intelligent, family-driven mammals that they are. Since there is no wolf hunting in this area of Ellesmere Island, wolves view humans in a passive manner, rather than a fearful one. This allows for unparalleled access to their day-to-day lives like nowhere else on Earth. My goal for this story is to remind us that wolves are complex social mammals that exist in nearly the same family structures as humans and engage in many of the same behaviors: play, mourning, social learning, and hunting strategies. 
While wolves around the world are continually vilified and killed at will, here on Ellesmere they live out their lives free from the report of a rifle and the teeth of a trap.

As I spent time in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge documenting the porcupine caribou herd earlier this summer, the first polar bears arrived on the coast. The loss of sea ice forced them to land in early July. Since then, many more polar bears have come ashore. As the bears are waiting for the Arctic Ocean to freeze over, the fight to protect Alaska’s refuge continues in Washington D.C.: The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to restore the decades-long ban on oil drilling. The drilling was authorized under the 2017 tax cut signed into law by President Trump. In the meantime, the Interior Department released its final environmental impact statement on drilling in the refuge, with the aim to allow leasing of the entire coastal plain.

Polar expedition guide Françoise Gervais plays her accordion on the stern of a ship near the Lemaire Channel in Antarctica. Originally from Quebec, Françoise is a deep-sea explorer, environmental conservation specialist, polar expedition leader, and cold-water diver—and one of the many remarkable women I've photographed as part of an ongoing series about women who work in Antarctica. “What I’ve realized over the years is that a lot of women don’t realize they can do things: go on expeditions, take leadership roles, or work in extreme environments,"" she says. ""It’s not even in their subconscious. A lot of people don’t even consider guiding in the polar regions an option as a woman—and leading is a whole other story. You imagine Shackleton or Scott or Franklin. We keep hearing their names again and again. And we don’t even hear about the women.” Follow me @acacia.johnson for more stories from Antarctica and beyond. #antarctica #womeninantarctica #polar

The road is a time for remembering and forgetting, for moving ahead and getting lost on purpose, where the journey is the destination. So it has been with us. A few days into our journey, we left Mojave, California, in search of salt flats and scorched sand and found our way into the empty Panamint Valley. At the cut-off toward Death Valley, we pulled off for a minute and stared down the long highway shimmering in the evening heat. We'd done the math and thought we could make it to the next charging station before our electric vehicle's power drained. But that's not the same as being certain. We forged on.

The properties on either side of the road are private ranches that have been protected by perpetual conservation easements, funded by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and other partners. There was already a bridge at this site for cars and trucks to cross over a canal. By adding ledges to the sides of the canal (where TNC Conservation Projects Manager Wendy Mathews walks; third photo) and high fencing on either side of the bridge, conservationists were able to encourage panthers to cross beneath the road rather than through traffic above. Vehicles kill nearly 30 Florida panthers on roads each year—the leading cause of death for the endangered puma. With the pictured segment of the statewide Florida Wildlife Corridor secure, panthers and other wildlife can now move safely from large public lands up to the southern banks of the Caloosahatchee River and the northern Everglades beyond. The Caloosahatchee had been a long-standing barrier to the northward movement of female panthers until late 2016, when the first female panthers were detected on the north side of the river in nearly 50 years. For Florida panthers to reach sustainable numbers, they need access to their historic territory in central and north Florida.

For thousands of years, Inupiat villagers along Alaska’s North Slope have hunted marine mammals such as seal, walrus, and whale. Hunting, fishing, and foraging for food, known as subsistence, remains one of the most significant aspects of life in Inupiat communities. A child’s first seal hunt is an important rite of passage, especially now as these traditions are being challenged as a result of climate change. 
July was officially the warmest month in Alaskan history, and Utqiagvik, the northernmost town in the United States, has been labeled “ground zero for climate change.” With Arctic permafrost thawing much faster than expected, the resulting release of carbon gases could drastically speed up climate change—and communities like Utqiagvik will feel it first."

Diego's a Canary Mastiff. He's wise beyond his 12 years and may be immortal, like some sort of half-human, half-dog mythical animal that possesses magical powers and speaking abilities. Legions follow him and graciously offer whole roasted supermarket chickens as peace offerings. ⁣⁣

Diego's substantial tongue betrays a previous life he'd rather not discuss, but it's functional most of the time if his jaw cooperates. Senior dogs like Diego often get overlooked for adoptions. It's hard to imagine anyone overlooking him. ⁣⁣

A single whale can feed a community for much of a year if the meat and blubber are properly stored, which traditionally has been done in ice cellars. These generations-old, massive underground freezers are dug deep into the permafrost. But as permafrost thaws, it wreaks havoc, melting what used to be permanently frozen ground and destroying and flooding ice cellars.

Every summer he digs in the Dakotas, Wyoming, or Montana, often with his oldest daughter, Adie, who found the mosasaur. To him, fossils represent a key to our biological past.

Visit the link in my bio or nationalgeographic.com/animals to learn how new toll roads could block the panther’s path to recovery. I’ve been covering the story of the Florida panther for the past three years using custom-made camera traps through my Path of the Panther project with @insidenatgeo. The Florida panther is the last subpopulation of pumas surviving in the eastern United States. It has persevered because of its ability to live in the hurricane-battered swamps of the southern Everglades, where as few as 20 panthers survived the hunting and persecution that eliminated pumas everywhere east of the Mississippi River. It’s from these Everglades swamps that the panther has staged its recovery, and is beginning to reclaim its historic territory in the northern Everglades and beyond. Panthers need expansive territory. One panther's home range is up to 200 square miles—ten times the size of Manhattan. That makes the Florida panther an umbrella species, which means protecting habitat for one panther helps protect habitat for hundreds of other species. As shown in these photos, a Florida black bear, white egret, American alligator (with a giant salamander in its mouth), and coyote all share the same trails with the panther. To learn more about the different species, how these photos were made, and what happened when Hurricane Irma hit my camera traps a few days after this panther photo was captured, please visit @carltonward.

This young man and I were riding out on the colony’s land that spread out below the mountain ranges of central Montana. I remember what a beautiful late afternoon it had been, and how the clouds darkened as they momentarily obscured the sun and dramatically silhouetted the young horseman. That assignment was the beginning of a lifetime relationship with some of the Hutterites, who have become almost like a second family to me over the years. I’ve done articles for National Geographic about the Hutterites, one published in July 1970 and the other in the June 2006 issue.

The park is a large-scale scientific experiment run by father and son, Siberian scientists Sergey and Nikita Zimov. They believe that by recreating the ecosystem of the Pleistocene era, which was dominated by grasslands and large mammals, they can slow down permafrost thaw. To test this theory, they created Pleistocene Park, a site along a tributary of the Kolyma River that is home to imported wild horses, like the ones seen here, as well other animals like bison, yaks and moose. 
Arctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change. As a result, climate scientists—permafrost experts, in particular—say all signs point to the need for urgent and audacious action. As writer @craigwelch asks in our recently published @natgeo article (link in my bio), “Is trying to save permafrost by restoring the Arctic steppe really so much crazier than counting on humans to quickly retool the world’s energy system? Maybe we need a little craziness.”"

The focus this year is suicide. Close to 800,000 die due to suicide every year—it’s the second  leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. Refugees are particularly vulnerable. On the Greek Island of Lesbos, self-harm and attempted suicide rates among refugees are alarmingly high, especially with children. In July and August, 73 children were referred to @DoctorsWithoutBorders (MSF) mental health teams; three had attempted to kill themselves, and 17 were self-harming. Ten of the 73 children were under the age of six. MSF has been calling for their emergency evacuation. Declan Barry of MSF said: ""These children come from countries that are at war, where they have experienced extreme levels of violence and trauma. Rather than receiving care and protection in Europe, they are instead subjected to ongoing fear, stress and episodes of further violence.""

Arctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change. As a result, climate scientists—permafrost experts, in particular—say all signs point to the need for urgent and audacious action. In the far reaches of Siberia, a father and son are doing just that. Permafrost scientist Sergey Zimov and his son Nikita have created Pleistocene Park along the Kolyma river in the northeast of Siberia. The park operates as a nature reserve, research station, and large-scale scientific experiment. The Zimovs believe that they can slow down permafrost thaw by recreating the ecosystem of the Pleistocene era, which was dominated by grasslands and large, grazing animals that helped maintain and fertilize grass. Grasses absorb far less sunlight and heat than trees or tundra. 
To test this theory, they have imported wild horses, like the ones seen here, as well other animals like bison, yaks, and moose. In 2018 the Zimovs joined forces with Harvard University geneticist George Church, who thinks he can clone a woolly mammoth. The hope is that one day those now extinct beasts will be stomping around Pleistocene Park."

This is a massive algae bloom on Lake Erie, one of the five Great Lakes in North America. The boat in the frame, a small research vessel, is intended for scale—the sheer size of the bloom extends for miles upon miles outside the edges of this photo. These lakes collectively make up 84% of North America’s freshwater and 21% of the world's. Seeing pollution on this scale should have us all outraged at the sheer mismanagement of this precious resource. The Great Lakes have long been a place where chemicals, toxic pollutants, pesticides, and metals have been dumped from a large array of industry. These pollutants are flushed into tributary rivers that extend hundreds of miles throughout the Great Lakes Basin and then into the Mississippi River, which exits into the Gulf of Mexico, and the St. Lawrence River, which pours into the Atlantic. Even in small concentrations, many of these toxins have been linked to cancer, birth defects, and immune deficiencies. Although the pollution issue was much greater in the past, it’s still happening even today, and many of these toxins can take thousands of years to break down. The algae seen here is the product of excess phosphors in the water that cause these blooms when the temperatures increase. It’s not toxic to the touch, but if ingested, even through small droplets while swimming, water skiing, etc., it’s enough to make you sick. Illnesses and toxins can include dermatotoxins, hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, and cytotoxins. It’s a sad and serious issue. To see more from my Great Lakes assignment, please visit @ladzinski"

And today, I'm sharing my dream assignment. “The Underdogs” is a portfolio featuring shelter and rescue dogs that are difficult to find homes for because they are a little different. They may have special needs, but you'll see that they are truly special. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Echo is an engaging nine-year-old who was born deaf but is a great listener. You can talk about anything with her and she understands perfectly. Echo will look you straight in the eye and make you feel good about your ideas, no matter how bad they might sound. ⁣⁣

When I was nine, I pretended to hear but did not listen. I feared doctors long enough to let an easily correctable hearing problem affect my friendships, safety, and schoolwork. My mom figured it out when our television caught fire one day. I was sitting just a few inches away from the screen, oblivious and engrossed in smoke with after-school cartoons broadcasting at maximum volume. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In her youth Echo was a wild dog, a rescue who enjoyed eating things she shouldn't have. Then along came an opportunity to work with dogs and other animals as a career counselor. It's a job she's taken to heart over the last eight years as a foster parent and role model to countless rescued puppies, kittens, chicks, and ducklings. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
She's a terrier, full of Boston and bull, who wins people over with her keen sense of humor and clever piglike grunting noises that have earned her the nickname Pig-Dog. ⁣⁣

Echo teaches us that we are all unique, have different gifts, and have different ways of saying to the world who we are. Long live Pig-Dog. ⁣⁣

This traditional blanket toss was held at Point Hope, Alaska’s annual whaling feast celebration in 2015. 
For the people of Point Hope, nothing is more important than the bowhead whale. Their calendar year revolves around whaling, hunting, fishing, and gathering, a lifestyle Alaskans call subsistence, which is as much cultural tradition as dietary and economic necessity. This tradition is at risk as a result of climate change. Erosion and thawing permafrost are destroying ice cellars that store the meat while at the same time eating up the landscape, making travel and hunting increasingly dangerous on the fragile, shifting ground.

Humpback moms invest a great deal in their offspring, with a gestation period that lasts about a year.

It can mean different things to different people. The reasons can be deeply personal, or about sharing an incredible experience with your climbing partners. For some it becomes a meditation in being present. Life stripped to the basics—movement through the landscape with purpose. At its most raw, it can be about survival.⁠ Conrad Anker has made a career seeking out, exploring, and climbing some of the most remote unclimbed walls in the world. Beyond climbing, he has been a mentor to new generations of climbers, and also worked to protect the wild landscapes he loves. But at the end of the day, he still loves climbing. Here in minus 20°F temps, he ascends a new 4000-foot route on Ulvetanna, aka the Wolf’s Fang, in Antarctica.

She is the first female panther documented north of Caloosahatchee River since 1973. Biologists from the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission got the first photos of her in November 2016, and allowed me to set up a camera trap nearby. I got my first photo of the mother in January 2017. When I showed it to David Shindle, head panther biologist for the US Fish & Wildlife Service, he said, ""I've been dreaming about her for 18 years."" I captured this photo with cubs a year later. For 44 years, the breading population of Florida panther—the last puma surviving in the east—had been isolated to the southern tip of Florida. The species will never reach sustainable numbers without access to its historic territory in the northern Everglades and beyond. Just as this female panther gives new hope, a new toll road threatens to cut through and develop the last wild places that panthers need.

Over centuries people and communities in the Arctic have used ice cellars to safely store fish and meat that will feed them through the long winters ahead. Permafrost thaw is seriously challenging this practice, and as a result, changing the way of life for people from Siberia to Alaska. Soon, the rest of the planet may also feel the impact.

Adam uses no-till farming—he doesn’t plow, for example—and rotates crops, all of which is good for soil building. Agriculture is a big player in the environment. If done on a global scale, good farming practices can be a powerful tool in fighting climate change. // @IndigoAg is unlocking agriculture’s potential to help reverse climate change. That’s the vision behind the Terraton Initiative, a global movement with the goal of using regenerative farming practices to take one trillion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 240 km (150 mi) east of the Horn of Africa and 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as the ""most alien-looking place on Earth.” In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 species found nowhere else; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more impressive numbers. 
In the foreground, the Socotra desert rose, or bottle tree, can be seen—one of the island's endemic plants. The plant is highly poisonous and unpalatable to livestock, and despite being widespread on the island, is considered vulnerable and therefore included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species.

The layers of fossil-rich rock date to the end of the Cretaceous period and contain a valuable record of the world just before the dinosaurs became extinct. Many scientifically important fossils have been found here, including the world’s first identified T. rex, in 1902. In the United States, fossils found on private property usually belong to the landowner, and collectors may strike deals with owners to dig on their land.

All the villagers bring nets and baskets, and within moments it’s a mud-soaked frenzy, with over 3,000 people in the water. Fishing camps are banned within the park and in border areas, as they often become poaching camps. Fish populations also desperately need
to recover from unrelenting commercial operations. The park employs locals for all its work as a means of compensation, and there seems to be understanding as a result. Pendjari anchors the transnational West-Arly–Pendjari reserve, which covers 35,000 square kilometers.

Today I’m in Liwonde National Park, Malawi an important stop on our official tour of southern Africa, planting trees for the Queens Commonwealth Canopy. As part of this takeover, I am inviting you to be a part of our ‘Looking Up’ social campaign. To help launch the campaign, here is a photograph I took today here in Liwonde of Baobab trees. “#LookingUp seeks to raise awareness of the vital role trees play in the Earth’s ecosystem, and is an opportunity for all of us to take a moment, to appreciate the beauty of our surroundings. So, join us today and share your own view, by looking up! Post images of the trees in your local community using the hashtag #LookingUp. I will be posting my favourite images from @NatGeo photographers here throughout the day, and over on @sussexroyal I will be sharing some of my favourite images from everything you post. I can’t wait to see what you see when you’re #LookingUp 🌲 🌳” ••• His Royal Highness is currently on an official tour to further the Queens Commonwealth Canopy, which was launched in 2015. Commonwealth countries have been invited to submit forests and national parks to be protected and preserved as well as to plant trees. The Duke has helped QCC projects in the Caribbean, U.K., New Zealand, Australia, Botswana, Malawi, and Tonga. Now, almost 50 countries are taking part and have dedicated indigenous forests for conservation and committed to planting millions of new trees to help combat climate change.

The Duke’s longtime passion for trees and forests as nature’s simple solution to the environmental issues we face has been inspired by the work he has been doing on behalf of his grandmother, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, for many years."

Much like this mandrill, we humans are primates too, and we rely on eye contact, along with body language, for 80% or more of our communication. At Team Photo Ark, our driving motto is this: As these species vanish, so could we. I had gone to Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea to cover primate poaching. On one of my last days on the island, I went to a bush meat market, and found this juvenile mandrill chained to the rusting frame of an old car.  As a friend held up a black velvet cloth behind him, he reacted to seeing himself for the first time in the reflection of my lens filter. This animal was someone's pet, but there were laws on the books against keeping primates, so he could have been made into stew at any time if the price was right, especially being so close to the market.

They are called vicious, false, and nasty, but all these are mostly human traits. Spotted hyenas are formidable, strong hunters, and efficient scavengers, and there are of course many sides to this incredible predator. I took this photograph of this cub greeting its mother in Mombo Camp in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Even though hyenas look a lot like dogs, in fact they are more closely related to cats. Young hyenas are called cubs, and female hyenas are wonderful moms. They take excellent care of their babies, and most hyenas provide their cubs with milk for over one year. This is probably a necessity, as many kills are made far from the den, and hyenas do not bring back food and regurgitate it for their young. At about one year, cubs begin to follow their mothers on their hunting and scavenging forays. Until then, they are left behind at the den with a babysitting adult.

What you’re seeing here is a decades-old problem; the leading contributor of these blooms is excess phosphorus and nitrates from fertilizer used in large-scale agriculture that’s washed into streams as well as distributed via wind during the winter months. Through these tributary waterways, the chemicals eventually make their way into lakes. Pollutants from industrial and pharmaceutical factories are also a link; these chemicals and substances aren’t water soluble and over decades turn into what you’re seeing here. High temperatures and still air create the perfect conditions for algae to proliferate and accumulate at the surface. When temperatures increase, these blooms break out, which is unfortunately only increasing with the rise in temperatures directly correlated with climate change. It’s a serious problem, and one that is happening globally. To see more photos of this issue, please visit @ladzinski"

Just a few days ago, more than 80 migrants were finally rescued from the Open Arms rescue ship, after 120 days of being stranded at sea in the Mediterranean and denied entry by Italian authorities. 
During 2014-2016, I made five trips at sea to document the plight of migrants and refugees attempting to cross the Mediterranean, an often deadly journey. Thousands of sub-Saharan Africans who had traveled for weeks, sometimes months, to reach the shores of Libya are often tortured and beaten, and thousands perish each year on the journey. 
Migrants were then routinely forced by Libyan traffickers into overcrowded rubber dinghies, meant for short journeys, and sent toward the Italian coast, where they often ended up drifting at sea or drowning as their dinghies sank or engines failed. 
In 2018, the European Commission voted to side with Italy in no longer allowing rescue ships to operate in the Mediterranean.
According to data from UNHCR, two percent of people who attempt the crossing die and an estimated 2,275 migrants perished in the Mediterranean in 2018. To follow more of my work, follow @lynseyaddario."

Marta, a survivor of assault, sits with her husband, Apolinar, in their home. Marta describes Apolinar’s support as instrumental to her healing.

Marta is part of the Malaya Lolas, a group of grandmothers in the Philippines who were collectively assaulted more than seven decades ago in a mass rape during the Second World War. In the absence of working structures to seek support and reparations, they came together, formed friendships, and rebuilt their town, which was reduced to ashes. ""We aren’t strong enough to protest in the streets anymore,"" one of the grandmothers told me. ""But we want to tell our story."" I worked on this story more than a decade after my own grandmother told me about her trauma from the war. She cannot form sentences anymore, but it felt necessary to try to recall what she wanted to impart. These grandmothers—and my own—showed me that the stories we are told are living histories that we all have a part to play in writing.

John was born in an internment camp above the river in the village of Kamuturi in 1961, during a period of “emergency law,” when British colonists interned tens of thousands of Kenyans as they sought to suppress an armed movement for independence. The story of his birth reminds me, as other situations have, that men can enact violence and cruelty even in the most serene of places. 
In the coming days I’m sharing photos and excerpts of an essay that appears in the August issue of @natgeo magazine. I travel a lot and people often ask about my favorite place. Without equivocation, it is the lush highlands of central Kenya. There is no place closer to my heart.

Prior to the war, both women used to live in a family house in the suburban village of Opytne, between Donetsk and Avdeevka, in eastern Ukraine. They had to flee when their street became a front line—a powerful explosion buried Lira alive under the wreckage. Altogether the house got three direct artillery hits.
Now they live in Tatiana’s daughter’s apartment in Avdeevka. This apartment was also damaged by shelling and repaired by the women on their own. “My daughter has a real talent! She has fixed it so nicely you could never tell there was a huge hole in this wall,” she proudly tells us. Her husband, Aleksander, chose to rebel against the war’s indignity in his own way: like many people in eastern Ukraine, he refuses to leave his demolished house. He continues living in the basement–the only surviving part–and cultivates the garden. Every day he takes a bike ride through the minefield that separates Opytnoe from Avdeevka to visit his wife. Tatiana prepares him a meal to take back, as he has no kitchen left in the ruins.
Tatiana lost a court hearing over compensation for her house. She felt humiliated by the attitude of the hearing members: “They would ask me questions like, why do I think that my house was shelled? Then they turned to a witness and began interrogating her about what brand of refrigerator I had and how many burners there were on the gas stove. They were talking to us like they assumed we were lying and it was their job to catch us out.” Ukraine’s official position is that Russia is to blame for the war, and so all claims should be addressed across the border.

Living in the pelagic zone (open ocean), oceanic whitetips are shaped like aircrafts, with long pectoral fins that allow them to glide efficiently over long distances, expending little energy. 
In 2006, I led a trip to Cat Island in The Bahamas, where we discovered a population of this species in one of the few locations left where these animals predictably can be found. Oceanic whitetip populations have been decimated due to the demand for their fins, which are prized for shark fin soup. Like the American bison, an animal that was once abundant and then hunted to the brink, only a fraction of oceanic whitetip shark populations remains today. Their numbers declined 93% between 1995 and 2010. Recovery will be difficult, because they reach sexual maturity by age seven and have small litters of pups every one to two years.

Shortly before the war, they built a beautiful family house in Marinka, a suburb of the regional capital Donetsk.

It’s been five years since then, and the family still has no access to the house, even just to take a look. Soldiers at the checkpoint in the middle of their street will not let them through.
Condolences aside, this situation leaves Marina with no chance of compensation. The Ukrainian state and international humanitarian organizations operating in the area both rely on the same procedure: a destroyed housing site first must be inspected by a special commission. No access to the site, no aid. Ironically, this approach excludes precisely those who suffered most by losing any chance to return home. In the government-controlled part of the Donetsk region alone, over a thousand apartment buildings and 12,000 private houses were damaged or destroyed during the war. Half of them remain unrepaired, and their inhabitants are at best displaced like Marina, at worst, homeless.

Satichewadi was only a few years into the watershed program, and already most of the village's land was carefully sculpted to prevent water from running off.

Cooper is short a leg but missing nothing in life.⁣⁣

Once upon a time he was a shelter dog, and fortunately that time has passed. Cooper is now a liveaboard on a sailboat where he serves as first mate. He is passionate about water and marine life, and he’s always on the lookout for dolphins. He does not like cats but rarely sees them when he is at sail. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
He's a seven-year-old Rhodesian ridgeback mixed with miniature American shepherd and Labrador retriever and is known for his party tricks and leadership.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In my years as an animal photographer, I've found that many dogs like music, yet few take the time to learn the lyrics to a song as Cooper has. In the studio we found ourselves in a lively duet to the hit song “Who Let the Dogs Out.” Cooper can be seen in the last image answering with the familiar refrain, ""Woof, woof, woof, woof.""⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I fall in love with other people's dogs nearly every day. Cooper is one that got away.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Today I'm sharing images from “The Underdogs,” a portfolio of shelter and rescue dogs that are difficult to find homes for because they are a little different. They may have special needs, but they are truly special.⁣⁣

Starting at 20,000 feet (6,000m) from Advanced Basecamp with a load of oxygen bottles up to 100 lbs, they carry gear all the way to high camp, near 28,000 feet (8,300m), and back in a single push through the night, only stopping to hydrate and eat at the North Col.

Each atoll we reached was unique: some full of fishermen, some famous for black pearl farms, others bristling with kids and dolphins, and one was inhabited by just two people drying copra (coconut).

I witnessed his curiosity, passion, and intellect firsthand, and we explored the remarkable science and history within the walls of the JPL. We began in Mission Control, where this image was taken. This area is known as the “center of the universe,” where all communications from the Deep Space Network enter through this one facility. We then visited the In-Situ Instrument Lab, known as the sandbox, where the surface of the red planet is replicated in order to test commands to the InSight lander and Curiosity rover via exact replicas. The fact that scientists will create billion-dollar instruments in this sandbox made me reflect on the obvious connection between creativity, science, and play. Learning about the InSight lander in particular, from its shock-absorbing legs to the tiny rockets that stabilize it during landing, was especially fascinating. The biggest highlight was when scientists turned the actual camera of the replica InSight onto Brad; he held perfectly still for 60 seconds as it captured his image. I'm thrilled to include this image in our related Instagram Story. // See Brad Pitt in #AdAstra, in theaters everywhere tomorrow."

Please see the new National Geographic article by Douglas Main about how new toll roads threaten to block the recovery of the Florida panther.

In the second photo, a male Florida panther crosses safely beneath Interstate 75 from Picayune Strand State Forest to Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge. This section of I-75 between Naples and Miami cuts through millions of acres of public land and primary panther habitat, including Big Cypress National Preserve. Thanks to cross fencing and more than 30 wildlife underpasses, there are rarely panthers or other large wildlife killed on the highway. The lesson is that wildlife crossings work very well, and all new roads through the  wildlife corridors should have them. But even more important: we must conserve millions of acres of missing links in the Florida Wildlife Corridor for a connected habitat network to support wildlife crossing.

But this decline has now been recognized, and they've just been given formal protection for the first time as well. The Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) have listed giraffes on Appendix II, thereby ending unregulated trade. Their challenges are far from over, but trade regulations do make a difference.

This protected area, located off Ambergris Caye, was created in 1987, and has allowed marine life and ecosystems to thrive. Researchers report that at least 30% of Earth’s oceans must be protected in order to have a healthy planet, yet today only about 3% has been conserved. The ocean is the greatest carbon sink on Earth, taking in carbon and giving back oxygen. But as fish are removed in alarming numbers, habitats are destroyed and increased amounts of
carbon from fossil fuels are turning seawater acidic. As a result, the ocean loses its ability to function efficiently. Creating more marine protected areas is not only good for fish, but for all life on Earth. To learn more about ocean exploration follow @BrianSkerry. #belize #mesoamericanreef #marineprotectedareas"

Bob was rescued by my cousin Odette, who works as a veterinarian on the island of Curaçao. Odette discovered that the flamingo developed an arthritic condition on both of his feet—one of the reasons he couldn't be released back to the wild as he simply wouldn't survive. She now uses the bird for education purposes within Fundashon Dier en Onderwijs Cariben @fdoccuracao, which is why we also had a x-ray made of his beautiful long neck in addition to his feet. With 19 vertebrae, flamingos actually have fewer neck vertebrae than many other long-necked birds. But having fewer vertebrae doesn’t necessarily mean that the neck is shorter; the bones themselves are longer. They are seen  as a series of angles, rather than as a continuous smooth curve. This allows flamingos to bend their neck backward or downward to clean their feathers or search for food—its neck is vital to filtering food from water, as a flamingo often needs to turn its head upside down in the process.

In sharing images and stories around these journeys, I’ve always hoped to inspire people to get outside, to go on their own journeys. I think people protect what they love, and when people spend time having meaningful experiences out in the wilderness, they discover their love for these places. Hopefully that has an impact on how they take care of them. For more images of wilderness adventures around the world, follow @jimmychin"

Who doesn’t know the mythical stories about these large birds bringing babies to new parents? In Ancient Egypt, the stork was associated with the soul. Greek and Roman mythology portrays storks as models of parental devotion. In Chinese wisdom, the stork is a symbol of longevity. In Christianity, the stork is linked with purification, and followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual ""pilgrimage"" through Mecca on their migration. 
However, since the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of white storks have chosen to stay on the European continent all year, rather than migrate to Africa in winter. The reason:  the guaranteed, abundant food supply from landfill sites, like this one in Portugal. While it is clear that the stork population has benefited from the large quantities of food, you don’t have to be a scientist to see something is wrong.
Confronting the enormous amount of waste we produce on a daily basis is truly horrifying. Walking through fields of empty bottles, plastic bags, food leftovers, and toys brings me to tears. I'm embarrassed to be part of our consumer society. We have to turn the tide. This story is not about storks—it is about us. It's time to make a decision: #planetorplastic?

Used for self-defense, the stinger is tipped with barbs that can rip through flesh when withdrawn. Each spine has grooves underneath that contain protein-based venom. The spines are constantly being shed and replaced, allowing the stingray to sometimes have two stingers, as a new stinger grows in to replace the older one.
