over the next couple of months, i lived with families in ethiopia, mali, and south africa. after initial interviews with the women, i found it easier to photograph without a translator and to just to be with them. 
their lives were not easy. i understood them more deeply as i fell into their patterns and rituals. they worked hard and valued cooperative relationships with other women. they were selfless and shared in common the desire to make their children’s lives better. i was touched by their caring manner and i admired their strength. 
i earned their trust. when photographing people i do not look for our differences, but how we are all the same. @thephotosociety @natgeofineart @natgeoimagecollection #ethiopia #africa #women

perhaps she resonates particularly with me because i spent so much time with her after dereck joubert and i had been badly injured by a buffalo. we learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. it should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn't going to give up on them. 
despite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn't have to chase them. every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. at the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. 
today fekeetsa's cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again. she has shown a spirit that i have seen in many women over the years—a knowledge that the responsibility lies with her and the complete refusal to accept failure.

the batagaika crater, roughly half a mile long and 300 feet deep, is one of the exceptions. the crater started forming in the 1960s after nearby forests were cleared, exposing the permafrost to the sun. when permafrost laced with ice thaws, the ground collapses and forms craters and lakes. to this day the crater continues to grow. the ancient soils of arctic permafrost, seen in the wall of the crater, hold the organic remains of leaves, grass, and animals that died thousands of years ago, during the ice age. all that carbon had been safely bound in frozen earth—until now. 
for nearly two years i've been working on “the carbon threat” for @natgeo (link in my bio @katieorlinsky): how arctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change. it is perhaps the least understood reason to hasten our transition off fossil fuels. time is of the essence, and i hope our reporting can help the public and policymakers recognize this new, urgent reality.","['mountainous landforms', 'mountain', 'hill', 'natural landscape', 'sky', 'highland', 'fell', 'landscape', 'ridge', 'terrain']",0.17622381451418767,1,0.01519420649856329,0.015233478508889675,0.923815906047821,0.015252037905156612,0.015265342779457569,0.015238978900015354,2

a wise man once said, “where there is life there is hope, but the time to act is now.” we are in danger of losing more than one million species to extinction. and we will suffer greatly,  as we are part of nature and everything on the planet is connected. nature is perfection.
all of us, and especially young people, need to take back the planet from the ones who care only about the short term. fifty-plus percent of the biodiversity is found in forests, and each tree produces enough oxygen for 12 people. we all need to work toward a future where we protect 50% of our planet–so we have a future for generations to come. take a walk in the woods and hear the symphony of nature in the birds and insects or walk on the beach. nature heals. i have hope; without it, what is left? believe.","['tiger', 'mammal', 'wildlife', 'terrestrial animal', 'vertebrate', 'bengal tiger', 'siberian tiger', 'felidae', 'whiskers', 'snout']",0.6418478303588925,1,0.015225708484649658,0.015399514697492123,0.01533114816993475,0.015202488750219345,0.9236612915992737,0.015179792419075966,3

upon returning one year later, the changes were profound, as seen here in the second photo. returning four years later, i could barely find signs that a massive wall of water, more than 100 feet high, had ever existed. thousands of new people had taken up residence, trees and plants had grown again in abundance. the landscape and those who now inhabited this area of sumatra have changed.

i wanted to tell a story about wolves in a wilderness without competition with humans and to show them for the intelligent, family-driven mammals that they are. since there is no wolf hunting in this area of ellesmere island, wolves view humans in a passive manner, rather than a fearful one. this allows for unparalleled access to their day-to-day lives like nowhere else on earth. my goal for this story is to remind us that wolves are complex social mammals that exist in nearly the same family structures as humans and engage in many of the same behaviors: play, mourning, social learning, and hunting strategies. 
while wolves around the world are continually vilified and killed at will, here on ellesmere they live out their lives free from the report of a rifle and the teeth of a trap. they exist as the key apex predators that they are, in turn bringing balance to the ecosystem. please follow along with @ronan_donovan for more imagery from this assignment and check out the digital article (link in @ronan_donovan bio), written by neil shea @neilshea13.","['wildlife', 'tree', 'organism', 'adaptation', 'plant']",0.27583764150563267,1,0.028301214799284935,0.859753429889679,0.028071925044059753,0.027973400428891182,0.027974560856819153,0.027925409376621246,3

caesar stands out in a crowd.⁣⁣

he's tall with striking good looks and impeccable manners, and he is formally attired at all times. yet caesar is never overdressed; like a canine james bond in a tuxedo, he always looks fashionable whether attending a posh dinner party or being chased through a moroccan desert by villains on motorcycles.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
he's a six-year-old great dane operating from an altitude that is well above sea level, yet he remains a gentle, humble, down-to-earth kind of guy.⁣⁣

there is certainly a dog for everybody, but not everybody is for every dog. that blue bandage healing up the sizable tail on caesar is all that remains of his former relationship with living conditions that were too small for a dog of his size and intellect. he's expected to make a full recovery on all counts and looks forward to his new home.⁣⁣

to test this theory, they have imported wild horses, like the ones seen here, as well other animals like bison, yaks, and moose. in 2018 the zimovs joined forces with harvard university geneticist george church, who thinks he can clone a woolly mammoth. the hope is that one day those now extinct beasts will be stomping around pleistocene park.","['natural landscape', 'nature', 'pasture', 'grassland', 'grazing', 'natural environment', 'sky', 'grass', 'landscape', 'wildlife']",0.17451673781194435,1,0.49048730731010437,0.015342696569859982,0.44849836826324463,0.015234917402267456,0.015234488993883133,0.015202236361801624,2

in her youth echo was a wild dog, a rescue who enjoyed eating things she shouldn't have. then along came an opportunity to work with dogs and other animals as a career counselor. it's a job she's taken to heart over the last eight years as a foster parent and role model to countless rescued puppies, kittens, chicks, and ducklings. ⁣⁣

for the people of point hope, nothing is more important than the bowhead whale. their calendar year revolves around whaling, hunting, fishing, and gathering, a lifestyle alaskans call subsistence, which is as much cultural tradition as dietary and economic necessity. this tradition is at risk as a result of climate change. erosion and thawing permafrost are destroying ice cellars that store the meat while at the same time eating up the landscape, making travel and hunting increasingly dangerous on the fragile, shifting ground.

in the foreground, the socotra desert rose, or bottle tree, can be seen—one of the island's endemic plants. the plant is highly poisonous and unpalatable to livestock, and despite being widespread on the island, is considered vulnerable and therefore included on the international union for conservation of nature's red list of threatened species.

to recover from unrelenting commercial operations. the park employs locals for all its work as a means of compensation, and there seems to be understanding as a result. pendjari anchors the transnational west-arly–pendjari reserve, which covers 35,000 square kilometers. this is the largest remaining intact ecosystem in west africa and is still in a state of mismanagement. the nonprofit african parks hopes to resolve that by initially addressing pendjari while working alongside the government of benin, which has invited the group in. this image is part of coverage for a story on @africanparksnetwork for an upcoming issue of @natgeo magazine. #conservation #fishing #benin #fishing #africa","['people', 'adaptation', 'human', 'photography', 'tribe', 'statue', 'art']",0.11360986664177875,0,0.8954253792762756,0.020858783274888992,0.02093503437936306,0.020874325186014175,0.020891839638352394,0.02101466804742813,1

just a few days ago, more than 80 migrants were finally rescued from the open arms rescue ship, after 120 days of being stranded at sea in the mediterranean and denied entry by italian authorities. 
during 2014-2016, i made five trips at sea to document the plight of migrants and refugees attempting to cross the mediterranean, an often deadly journey. thousands of sub-saharan africans who had traveled for weeks, sometimes months, to reach the shores of libya are often tortured and beaten, and thousands perish each year on the journey. 
migrants were then routinely forced by libyan traffickers into overcrowded rubber dinghies, meant for short journeys, and sent toward the italian coast, where they often ended up drifting at sea or drowning as their dinghies sank or engines failed. 
in 2018, the european commission voted to side with italy in no longer allowing rescue ships to operate in the mediterranean.
according to data from unhcr, two percent of people who attempt the crossing die and an estimated 2,275 migrants perished in the mediterranean in 2018. to follow more of my work, follow @lynseyaddario.","['water transportation', 'inflatable boat', 'vehicle', 'recreation', 'boat', 'team', 'crew', 'tourism', 'boats and boating--equipment and supplies', 'raft']",0.12628257726480474,0,0.015209829434752464,0.9235536456108093,0.015309467911720276,0.01544259861111641,0.015296495519578457,0.015187927521765232,1

this picture, in the heart of the amazon, is for me a reminder of how we should join forces and find solutions to survive on our planet sustainably. the amazon rainforest is a place that most inspired me at the beginning of my career; today i think it should inspire everyone to take a step in the right direction, toward taking care of our fragile environment. to discover more stories about our environment and the innovative solutions we are putting into work to save it, please follow me at @lucalocatelliphoto

marta, a survivor of assault, sits with her husband, apolinar, in their home. marta describes apolinar’s support as instrumental to her healing.

marta is part of the malaya lolas, a group of grandmothers in the philippines who were collectively assaulted more than seven decades ago in a mass rape during the second world war. in the absence of working structures to seek support and reparations, they came together, formed friendships, and rebuilt their town, which was reduced to ashes. ""we aren’t strong enough to protest in the streets anymore,"" one of the grandmothers told me. ""but we want to tell our story."" i worked on this story more than a decade after my own grandmother told me about her trauma from the war. she cannot form sentences anymore, but it felt necessary to try to recall what she wanted to impart. these grandmothers—and my own—showed me that the stories we are told are living histories that we all have a part to play in writing.

now they live in tatiana’s daughter’s apartment in avdeevka. this apartment was also damaged by shelling and repaired by the women on their own. “my daughter has a real talent! she has fixed it so nicely you could never tell there was a huge hole in this wall,” she proudly tells us. her husband, aleksander, chose to rebel against the war’s indignity in his own way: like many people in eastern ukraine, he refuses to leave his demolished house. he continues living in the basement–the only surviving part–and cultivates the garden. every day he takes a bike ride through the minefield that separates opytnoe from avdeevka to visit his wife. tatiana prepares him a meal to take back, as he has no kitchen left in the ruins.
tatiana lost a court hearing over compensation for her house. she felt humiliated by the attitude of the hearing members: “they would ask me questions like, why do i think that my house was shelled? then they turned to a witness and began interrogating her about what brand of refrigerator i had and how many burners there were on the gas stove. they were talking to us like they assumed we were lying and it was their job to catch us out.” ukraine’s official position is that russia is to blame for the war, and so all claims should be addressed across the border.

condolences aside, this situation leaves marina with no chance of compensation. the ukrainian state and international humanitarian organizations operating in the area both rely on the same procedure: a destroyed housing site first must be inspected by a special commission. no access to the site, no aid. ironically, this approach excludes precisely those who suffered most by losing any chance to return home. in the government-controlled part of the donetsk region alone, over a thousand apartment buildings and 12,000 private houses were damaged or destroyed during the war. half of them remain unrepaired, and their inhabitants are at best displaced like marina, at worst, homeless.

cooper is short a leg but missing nothing in life.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
once upon a time he was a shelter dog, and fortunately that time has passed. cooper is now a liveaboard on a sailboat where he serves as first mate. he is passionate about water and marine life, and he’s always on the lookout for dolphins. he does not like cats but rarely sees them when he is at sail. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
he's a seven-year-old rhodesian ridgeback mixed with miniature american shepherd and labrador retriever and is known for his party tricks and leadership.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
in my years as an animal photographer, i've found that many dogs like music, yet few take the time to learn the lyrics to a song as cooper has. in the studio we found ourselves in a lively duet to the hit song “who let the dogs out.” cooper can be seen in the last image answering with the familiar refrain, ""woof, woof, woof, woof.""⁣⁣
⁣⁣
i fall in love with other people's dogs nearly every day. cooper is one that got away.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
today i'm sharing images from “the underdogs,” a portfolio of shelter and rescue dogs that are difficult to find homes for because they are a little different. they may have special needs, but they are truly special.⁣⁣

in 2018 ascend’s team attempted the unthinkable: to climb and summit the highest peak in afghanistan, mount noshaq (24,580 feet), which had never been climbed by an afghan woman. hanifa, shown in the following photos, became her nation’s first woman to complete the historic feat. says hanifa: “i did this for every afghan woman.” these images are part of the feature- length documentary film ""an uphill battle,"" set to release in 2021. #girlsarealsostrong #afghangirls #getoutside #forceofnature #sheexplores

however, since the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of white storks have chosen to stay on the european continent all year, rather than migrate to africa in winter. the reason:  the guaranteed, abundant food supply from landfill sites, like this one in portugal. while it is clear that the stork population has benefited from the large quantities of food, you don’t have to be a scientist to see something is wrong.
confronting the enormous amount of waste we produce on a daily basis is truly horrifying. walking through fields of empty bottles, plastic bags, food leftovers, and toys brings me to tears. i'm embarrassed to be part of our consumer society. we have to turn the tide. this story is not about storks—it is about us. it's time to make a decision: #planetorplastic?  follow @jasperdoest for more images of the human-wildlife relationship. #bethechange #notimetowaste #zerowaste #plasticfree","['bird', 'beak', 'ciconiiformes', 'stork', 'pelican', 'seabird', 'wildlife', 'adaptation', 'photography', 'pollution']",0.2538125744442489,1,0.9239580035209656,0.015218835324048996,0.015188240446150303,0.01521200593560934,0.015236925333738327,0.015185958705842495,3
