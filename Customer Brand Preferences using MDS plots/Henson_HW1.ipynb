       "['entry level performance luxury sedan are a hot area for car manufacturers and enthusiasts alike. these sedan show their performance by being fun to drive and handling well. they show luxury by offering leather and some of the important creatures comforts found in the most luxurious upscale sedans. the selection of vehicles that compete in the space is vast and varied.the benchmarks which define this are the bmw 330 and the audi audi 3.0. but there are many contenders, such as acura tl-s, chrysler 300m, jaguar x-type, infiniti i35, mercedes-benz c-class, volvo volvo t5. some companies have contenders that emphasize performance lexus is300 or luxury lexus es300. and the field is continously growing, with the recent additions being the cadillac cts and infiniti g35.the common charateristics of this entry level perfomance luxury group seem to a price around 30 to 40k (us dollars) and 0-60 times between six and eight seconds.with this wide variety of car targeted at a similar market segment, the choices for our own personal car are great. but with all these choices, it is hard to understand and personally evaluate all these options. so this topic has been created to start a discussion on the relative merits and personalities of the car available in this entry level performance luxury field. ',\n",
       " 'i personally think that with a few tweaks the c320 could also sit at the top of this group. it\\'s still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than mercedes-benz would lead you to believe. the c320 \"sport\" needs to have it\\'s suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. mb also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. the c240\\'s 6-speed wouldn\\'t hurt either if offered on the c320, though it needs to be \"fixed\" first. that said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new audi 3.0. the audi easily has the best interior of any sub-40k car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. the single thing i don\\'t like about the audi is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. this trim doesn\\'t match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. this is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40k. the upcoming audi convertible, coupe and s4 will all be winners. the bmw 330i is now an old favorite, but i\\'m (of all people) starting to tire of the bmw just a bit, save the bmw variants. i was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. i hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models. the acura tl-s is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. nice price, seat and what not, not hard to see why the tl is so popular. this car\\'s main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. otherwise a standout. lexus es300. nice, but not my type of car at all. this is one for the buick set. the is300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. styling is also in question here, it simply doesn\\'t look like a 35k car (grown). the interior is gawd-awful. bet on the next is300 being done right from the start. in their defense toyota didn\\'t initially intend for this car to be sold in the u.s. so it was a rush job. the cts holds the greatest unrealized potential here. i\\'ve seen several now, and each time i see one they look better and better. again like the c320, is300 the car has interior issues. the dash feels like it was made by rubbermaid. if you\\'re going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? the seat are very good though, as is the handling. a work in progress. the g35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. another great engine, waiting to drive this one.don\\'t really care much for the x-type. if i were a jaguar man i\\'d be truly pissed at ford and jaguar for this one. they are actually selling a fwd x-type in england and i\\'ve read where they\\'re thinking about selling it here! hell no. the car should have been rwd not awd. some will tell you that this was done to compete with audi. thats bs, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, without spending the money to convert the car to rwd. it is a good looking car though and that jaguar \"leaper\" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me. the chrysler chrysler is about as close to an audi that american car come. this new chrysler \"special\" is truly a good looking car inside and out. one problem: where is the performance???? a 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. something is not right here. some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, chrysler needs to let some mb engineers have a look at this car. the heavier e320 with less power is faster. i still like this car, but it\\'s no lust object once you get past the great styling. m ',\n",
       " \"i am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. the price difference between these two is approx. 6k (non-type s acura). is the es300 worth 6k over the tl? i don't know because i have never owned a tl but i am familiar with the es300(previous generation). supposedly the 2002 es300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the tl? of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. does the tl compare with the es300 in both of these categorys? i am not familiar with the honda co. are prices lower than lexus for service work? i would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some tl owners. \",\n",

       " \"one beauty of bmw 3 series is that there are so many models to choose from. almost half of all buyers in america don't get the basic rwd 4 door sedan. besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, awd, station wagon, and super-high performance m-series!!!hungrywhale... i concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!! \",\n",
       " \"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual. even with an auto, i prefer to every car listed and i never have owned an auto and never thought i'd enjoy driving a car with an auto. that's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car. once the g has a stick there is not another sedan under the bmw that i'd consider. \",\n",

       " \"i understand it's not about the speed. i really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as i rarely break the toyota mark. what i do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, i can get it when i want it. will i buy an auto-equipped g? in all likelihood, no. i desperately want to drive the 6 speed. \",\n",

(see the edmund\\'s bmw bmw discussion). i hope in your defense, reiz, that you drove the automatic infiniti g35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn\\'t classify as a performance sedan. i value your opinion and others as well.again, i\\'m not flaming you, but i try to be an informed consumer before i buy anything. that is the reason that i will drive every car that i\\'m interested in and make my choice from there. i\\'m also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car i\\'m shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.cheers! ',\n",
       " \"i think what riez and i are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them but any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan needs at least the option of a manual tranny. manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.there's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but i sure don't want one. \",\n",

       " \"even at 29k for a 35k msrp is300, i passed on it. now i never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, i don't think i'd go near one. they're not up to audi/bmw/mb/infiniti. \",\n",

(lol! see the latest discussions on the infiniti g35 vs bmw 330i board). first, i'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic. but she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice i'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. of course, it helps my cause when i let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. bribes do help! whatever i finally decide, i'm sure she'll be happy. \",\n",

       " \"i think both are excellent(sp?) cars, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. that is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance. what they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.as someone has said before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that. most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community. although i can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, i suspect that they are similar since i've heard (read) good things about both the audi cvt and the c240. something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology. both car are relative newcommers to the market. the facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the car will be as a whole.since you are already looking for alternatives to the mb because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the audi. as someone has suggested in the help me choose! forum, try looking to lexus for the answer. they seem to make reliable car that are also cheap to keep running. of course now we get into the issue of european vs asian luxury ... \",\n",
       " \"it has come to my attention that as of late mb has taken a hit in its reputation. people have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both european and domestic - that say mercedes-benz is no longer reliable. these surveys show that statistically speaking mb has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty. i won't deny these findings, but i will try and justify them. 1st and foremost, mb has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the car both inside and out. anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out. secondly, according to mbspy.com, mercedes-benz accounted for ~half of the profits by dcx last year. i think mb is being used as a cash cow to keep jeep and co affloat, thereby driving mercedes-benz to cost-cutting through corparate pressure. lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.these two should get things going ... feel free to agree or disagree. \",\n",

       " \"cybersol... i can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.comparing fwd to rwd is like apples to oranges.not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at. the 330i with options might push $40,000. you might really consider the much less expensive 325i. an nissan 3.5se with few options might have a $25,000 msrp.read motor trend's review of i35. their's had more than enough performance. 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test. and it can be had with a sport package. but you might be better off with a loaded nissan se or gle, saving thousands off the i35.you might also consider volkswagen passat. that can also be had with awd. if you like awd, the jag x-type should be on your list.from the domestic corner, you might also consider a lincoln ls 6 or 8. or chrysler 300m.surprised your list excludes the mercedes-benz c-class. and if you can live with a fwd automatic, a loaded toyota or honda v-6 or toyota might be acceptable near the altima's price range. \",\n",

       " 'congrats on your a4! look, no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the a4. i was so disappointed with the new styling because i always wanted the previous a4. so to see how it looks, personally, i hate it. maybe it is just me, but i just couldn\\'t come to grips with it.i found the audi felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller. i think it is unfair and untrue to say the \"ford\" thing, i think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not. the 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can). the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but i was not particularly enamored with the clutch. the steering, imo, was better than almost all. i just couldn\\'t justify the price difference when a certain car is trying to make an impression in a hot segment.like i said before, there are no losers in this segment, but i think it is safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype! ',\n",
       " 'i totally agree that it is all personal preference, and i really believe that most all of the car in this segment, especially the a4, s60, and x-type, are some of the best. i don\\'t think there is \"a best\" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences. they all have their own ups and downs, but i think the benefits of each of these car certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.on the x-type article:i read that autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before i went to check out the x-type and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end. jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problem in the current x-types though, and the ones being produced now don\\'t have any of those problems. i also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early x-type problems. the initial article was much like the autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after jaguar north america finally contacted them and worked on their cars. they had factory technicians go out and examine the car and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one. jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and i agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their x-types fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their car in the end.yes, some of the very early production x-types lived up to their old jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability. jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the whitley engineering center, who designed the driveshafts for the x-type, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.i can personally say from experience that the x-type is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problem at all. it initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since i\\'ve had it. i really love even just being around the car as it has been so good.again, it is all personal preference. when i sat in the jag for the first time, it just felt right. i hadn\\'t even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect. every time i sit in it, everything is perfect. the whole car is that way for me, and i bet your audi is the same for you.and if anyone is paying off the media it\\'s bmw and infiniti, and it appears that infiniti is paying the most. i don\\'t think jag even has the funds to do that:-) (although, global sales were just up 62% in april, and they\\'ve had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)and, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board. take care of your car!____________________________blueguydotcom-i actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it. the only incentive for the x-type is a pretty good lease price (i just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!). it\\'s also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher. i\\'d like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year. oh well, it is a jaguar after all, and a great car on its own. option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier.

(it currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that motor trend could have known of when it went to press.)\"http://www.abcnews.comhmmm. six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the ford is a favorite among car magazines like car&driver and motortrend. well, they can have it, and i\\'m sure you think it\\'s a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.abc also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars. even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said \"there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press\". motortrend\\'s own c. van tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.the warning at the end of the article reads: \"so far, the big magazines don\\'t seem to have changed their policies. so, be aware: when you read and see reviews of this year\\'s models, some of those reviews were written by reporters who\\'ve been fed and fueled by the car companies.\"it can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers. this is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.\"have you even taken the time to read what european car has written? or what mt and c&d have previously written?\" you also ask me. yes, i have. european car\\'s own review of the x-type is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car. road&track\\'s review of the x-type is also very complementary. car&driver tested the x-type\\'s 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about \"enthusiast goods\" of the car. motortrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say \"this new x is one shaggy jaggy\" and \"i\\'m anxious to try out the upcoming r version of the x-type, because this is a very good sport sedan\". autoweek liked the car and decided that \"x\" was definitely an addition to the \"a\", \"c\", and \"3\" in the sport sedan equation. forbes wrote a very fine review of the car. a vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the x-type. and again, autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the \"most important jaguar ever\" and said that between it and a 330i, they don\\'t know which one they would choose - \"it\\'s that close\".you mention \"american\" tests in your posts. i must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the x-type from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid? they are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count? there are people from all over the world here at edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?on the matter of that road&track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say:\"so how, you ask, did a car as nice as the jaguar x-type end up second to last in this great big comparison test? that\\'s easy: price.\"notice that they happened to also have loaded their x-type with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc. yet, other car in their test were not fully loaded as the jaguar was. the bmw, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the mercedes-benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a cd player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer). a test with price included is not valid unless all car are optioned out with the same equipment. the x-type had much more than any of the other car in the test did. a better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the car or prices of options, or get this: equip the car similarly. take note that both the saab and the mercedes-benz have higher starting prices than the jaguar, and that the jag\\'s starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other car in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other cars. awd is also standard on the jag, and extra-cost options on the car that can have it equipped. la ',\n",

why is it that when the x-type does win, excuses can be made for the other car(s), with \"they don\\'t ford on those areas\"? i\\'m willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there, but the x-type won out every other category of the test as well: engine, brakes, ride... i could just as easily say that the x-type doesn\\'t ford on those areas either, but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse. you also note that 1/2 second is not \"stomping anything to the ground\", yet in the road&track 11-car test, the x-type was just 0.6 second slower than the fastest car in the test, and it was marked down for that. we can\\'t suddenly make an exception for this test. i could say that the x-type doesn\\'t ford on acceleration in the r&t review, but again that is a poor excuse. if we choose to accept the r&t 11 car test, then we must, by principle, accept this test as well. in those regards, the x-type v. mercedes-benz comparison was quite valid.take care!__________________________________riez-i think i\\'ll terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say. it\\'s just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we don\\'t stop. but...i noticed that you still say the car falls flat, and in all of those comparisons, you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the car\\'s losing points, as well as r&t, c&d, and others noting that. i\\'m just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back, as i outlined how the x-type in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other car and that its price would have been closer to the others had the x-type been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test. also, as merc1 notes, 1/2 second differences, etc. are not large gaps. being 0.6 second off from the fastest car in the test, and 0.5 from the winning car is not \"falling flat\" by any means.you seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars, and instead only look at points and scores. take note of the \"luggage space\" scores for the car in the r&t 11 car test, for instance. the x-type has a boot capacity of 16.0 cubic feet. for that, it received 7.8 out of 10 possible points in that category. now look at the cadillac cts with a boot capacity of 12.8 cubic feet. yet it received 8.4 points out of the 10, and it had a smaller boot. the infiniti g35 has 14.8 cubic feet of boot space, yet even with less space than the x-type, it received the same score of 7.8 out of 10. the 330i, with only 10.7 cubic feet of boot space received 7.6 points, only 0.2 less point than the x-type with 5.3 more cubic feet than the 330i. these ratios aren\\'t right, and i cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies.i also still disagree with you about european or other comparison tests not being valid. included in these tests are car such as the x-type, c-class, and a4, et al, that are sold in the u.s., as well as car that are not available here. just because a car is not u.s.-spec doesn\\'t mean the test is totally invalid. in those other countries especially, those tests are very valid (as far as comparison tests go). it is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you, rather, it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test. that\\'s where the problem is, you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out. besides, the difference between a u.s.-spec car and a non-u.s.-spec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the u.s., etc. you can get a general idea still, and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an american magazine is a bit ignorant. especially as all of these car are global cars.you also claim that english reviews have a bias towards british car and that the germans also are biased. however, i have found that those two groups especially are very picky about car and will tear a car apart worse than any american reviewer would dare to. the british also have a thing for bmw\\'s - a german car - and i\\'ve not found a review where they had a bias for jaguar or any other british car, and if they were biased and i missed it, they certainly could not be any more biased than any american editors.perhaps you have not noticed the bias that american reviewers have for german and japanese cars? i believe edmunds stated something about their \"infatuation\" with \"everything german\" in a mercedes-benz review, and the idea that japanese car are so much more reliable than any other car is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of american writers (and don\\'t attempt to say that i\\'m saying that japanese car are not reliable now, because they are, i\\'m simply pointing out that there is an american bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car).

       " 'riez-you missed the target again. the trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the car in the tests do not tell the whole truth, as you misguidedly seem to believe. the fact of the matter is that the x-type had more boot space than the other car i mentioned, and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio, and that other scoring categories were similarly affected. you also failed to notice the phrases \"for example\" and \"for instance\" leading into what i was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that i was speaking about. you said of the x-type\\'s large boot \"and sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.\"from this i can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it, but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions, as the x-type does have multi-link boot hinges as opposed to the swan-neck hinges on such car as the xj8 and es300, ect. that you assumed it had, and then stated it had as if it were a fact. but what can i expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen?and on that topic, in the global car world of today, every car shares parts with another or many others. *for example* (<--if you miss it this time, i don\\'t know what to do), bmw uses general motors-sourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with mini. volkswagen and audi, seat, skoda, porsche, bentley, lamborghini, and bugatti all share many <i>many parts. daimlerchrysler and mercedes-benz share some parts now too, as well as sharing parts with hyundai and mitsubishi. making fun of that seems, well, kind of pathetic - unless you have a weird sense of humor. they share parts; yeah - so what? it\\'s not really relevant.and as i noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries, the car do have some differences from u.s.-spec car (as you and i had noted that engines can be different, etc.) but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests - as i had also said before in my other message. quite often, those tests even use the versions of the car equipped with engines that are sold with them in the u.s., as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us. if it\\'s a diesel-engine test, they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a \"diesel showdown!\" or something else to that same effect. again (for now the second time), you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in america. the car we are disputing are not even built in america. and many times, the versions of the car used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their u.s.-spec versions. alpha romeos, fiats, renaults, and vauxhalls are not sold in america, and thus i understand saying that for use in america, their tests would be for the most part inconcequential; but audis, jaguars, bmws, and mercedes-benz are all sold in the u.s. as well as foreign countries, and those foreign versions of the car have little difference from their u.s.-spec versions as far as any test categories can gauge. they never crash-test the car in these comparisons, and as c. van tune pointed out in the abc article about how reviewers are \"fed and fueled\" by certain car manufacturers, safety isn\\'t an exciting enough category for these tests, so to those reviewers who write about them, it is irrelevant. safety equipment is usually the primary difference between u.s.-spec and foreign versions of the same cars, but that\\'s not going to show-up in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things. yet it\\'s not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid, though. you are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree, which again just a display of your ignorance.as well as the boot-hinge thing that you got wrong (remember, x-type has the multi-link hinges with auto-opening gas struts, not swan-neck hinges), you also said that it had a cramped rear seat in comparison to its competators. in comparison to a long-wheelbase maybach, it is cramped, yes. however, it has one of the larger rear seat in its class. not only is it larger than the bmw 3-series\\' rear seat as well as the is300\\'s and a4\\'s, but it is also larger than the midsize 5-series\\' rear seat (but i\\'ll admit not by that much compared to the 5). in posts in other sections of the town hall, you defend how large the 5-series\\' rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes, why do you call the x-type\\'s rear seat - which is even larger than the 5\\'s - \"cramped\". is this yet another assumption that you made about the x-type?by now i am sure that you have noticed that i have continually refered to things in this message that i have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back. i\\'m wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same, and now you\\'re even making outright assumptions. no matter what i say and no matter how many facts i back my statements with, you seem to have your eyes closed to them and don\\'t even take them into account. not only that, but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions don\\'t even touch on facts or reality.and i\\'d say the best selling jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 56.7% of jaguar\\'s u.s. sales and holds an astonishing 66% of the entry-level to mid luxury segment in europe, as well as over 70% of jaguar\\'s sales in its third largest market, italy. was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part?maybe we\\'ll actually have a discussion when you start taking note of what\\'s actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks. good day.

       " 'ok, i read all that. so i\\'m supposed to believe jaguar\\'s claim over what every other brand claims right? until i see an independent test of all of the car in this class structural rigidity, i\\'ll go by what feels the most solid, and it isn\\'t the jaguar x-type. so we disagree there. secondly, everyone knows full well that the mercedes-benz is not on the same plane with the 330i and is300 when it comes to being \"sporty\". to impress me you\\'d have to beat those car at all the track tests. beating a c320 at the track isn\\'t hard, the is300 and 330i rule there. that acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference. i\\'m not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid, but i still maintain that they picked the areas in which the x-type would winout. and lastly the x-type has been ranked below the c in every other comparo done. if it were such a slaughter i\\'d think it would win some test over here too. m ',\n",

       " 'actually, this isn\\'t the x-type we have here in the u.s.\\nthis is the x-type section of the car crash test above:http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002take note that this is the \"jaguar x-type 2.0 lhd\" marked under the \"make, model and hand of drive\" portion of the chart at the bottom of the page. the x-type 2.0 is the low-end europe-only version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 2.5 and 3.0 litre models have that are sold globally (as well as the driveshaft that is found in the bmw and c-class). thus, its crash tests produce weaker results than the 2.5 and 3.0 versions, and bmw and c-class, because 2.0 is a fwd car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in awd (x-type) and rwd (c-class, 3-series) cars.check out this site:http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0210.htmit notes that the x-type underwent structural changes after december 2001 but does not say if that was a version-specific change (which i discovered it was). a letter to consumer reports aided research, and their reply was as follows:\"we spoke with jna (jaguar north america) on this question and they explained that the jaguar x-type was originally introduced in europe as a 2.0 litre fwd (front wheel drive) model. the only models sold in the u.s. are 2.5 and 3.0 liter awd versions.... that achieve better frontal crash test results than the fwd european model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear. the prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front, which accounts for the awd traction... the modifications made and referred to in iihs\\'s report on x-types (made) after december 2001 were actually modifications made to fwd european models and are not applicable to the u.s. awd models.\"(thanks \"jagdude\" and consumer reports for this information).also note that the reason why the mercedes-benz recieved a 5-star rating in the european test over the 4-star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that lit-up a sign reading the equivalent of \"fasten your seatbelt\" on its dash, which is to become a standard feature in europe in the future(?). it would have recieved that same 4-star rating had it not had the light. this is straight off the site:\"extra points awarded for the way that the mercedes-benz reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a five-star crash protection rating. results for the mercedes-benz were published last year and it achieved four stars. but euro ncap has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seat-belt warnings.\"all in all, i\\'d feel very safe in any one of the car in this class, and i do feel safe being in one of them. stay safe everyone. ',\n",
       " 'i honestly cannot remember a car i\\'ve been in that hasn\\'t had a seatbelt warning light. our 87 mercedes-benz 420 sel had it and my 99 honda honda has it. maybe this is due to european influence as the ford (originally introduced and designed in europe) has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other car i\\'ve been in have \"sensed\" the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well (i believe the landcruiser does this). however, as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the us, maybe this is a good idea after all. i can personally attest my safety and my mother\\'s life to seatbelts.btw jagboy, the euroncap x-type was a 2002 and it stated that the fwd 2.0 was released march of that year which is supported by both car and top gear magazines (british publications). in addition, i am relatively certain that the x-type was introduced as an awd model to differentiate it from the mondeo and to keep it from alienating jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a fwd jag (this is from a car article soon before the x-type itself was introduced in may of 2001). however, as the base 2.5 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a c180 or 318i in terms of value, jag decided to introduce the fwd 2.0 with a stick as standard. from what i understand, the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward, however, the larger engine block of the 3.0 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 2.0 with it\\'s fewer driveline components (obviously as it is fwd) so the crumple zones of the 2.0 have more room to crumple. i believe this is the reason why mercedes-benz decided to replace the 3.2 inline 6 of the e class with the smaller block of the 3.2 v6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although i\\'m not sure if mercedes-benz conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch. ',\n",
       " '\"they double their rigidity with every platform update... since it\\'s you telling me, i believe you, but that kinda boggles the mind... one would think there\\'s a point where you can\\'t go beyond?\"well...yes theoretically speaking, there is a point where you cant go beyond...but nothin on the face of this earth that has a perfect structural rigidity. we are talking about a large structure, on the scale of 100s of centimeters, which carries payloads of about 1000 pounds, and is subject to stresses incurred by hard braking and acceleration and cornering. not to mention the constraints that mass production places on structural rigidity. there is still a lot of flex in even the most rigid of automobiles. even full out race car have problem from structural rigidity...i believe the initial audi r8 had multiple problem with body flex...parts of the body would pinch and snap hoses and electrical lines. so, yes, there is tons of room for improvement in all car in the area of rigidity. ',\n",
       " 'yes, my x-type also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash. most all car do. in addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seat that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision. a small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger\\'s side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seat automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.\\nthe warning system in the mercedes-benz mercedes in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our car here. notice that the mercedes-benz had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other car in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that said \"put on your seatbelt\", the car\\'s score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say \"put on your seatbelt\" to be used in other cars. i\\'m not saying that the c does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other car in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt. it is not necessarily safer than the other car because of that light, and so i do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.you are also wrong about the 3.0 jaguar engine \"pushing\" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger. also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the x-type is designed to \"drop\" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash. most modern car do this. x-type\\'s engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines. again, however, the x-type drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used. the argument that a 2.0 fwd x-type would be safer than an awd larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.you really should read the bottom chart of the euroncap page for the x-type:http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002it specifically states that the car is: \"jaguar x-type 2.0 lhd. only the fwd x-type is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much. all other x-types are built in awd configuration. the awd driveshaft of the awd x-types aid in collisions v. the fwd version that is sold alongside them in europe against 318 and c180.mercedes-benz decided to changed to a v6 from an i6 because they lowered the bonnet of the mercedes-benz between those configurations and could not fit the i-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging. that is also the reason for the discontinuation of the e300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the v6 was introduced (that and because the e300 did not sell well here). the mercedes-benz should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well. i\\'ve not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision. ',\n",
       " 'while the mercedes-benz did gain an extra star because ncap changed it\\'s guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the c class did earn it\\'s full 5 stars as it\\'s a very well designed car collision-wise, when i can find the article in which ncap justified giving the c class an extra star b/c of it\\'s overall performance, i\\'ll paste the link. as the pre 2003 e class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it\\'s previous 4 when it doesn\\'t. the fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn\\'t as obvious is while the x-type is designed to, as you describe, drop it\\'s engine and driveline components, they will always \"push\" into the compartment as evidenced by the insurance institute\\'s listing of the crash details in which the x-type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm. the best rated c class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm. engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon. while i don\\'t doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, i wasn\\'t trying to prove one way or another, i was speculating on a possible alternative. and while i may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, i am certain that the e class\\' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine\\'s newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline. this is evidenced by the 99 e320 having the v6 with the prefacelifted hoodline. the discontinuation of the e300 in the u.ss was caused by the low demand for that particular car and b/c of the structural change. however, that never meant that mercedes-benz dropped diesels from it\\'s complete linup, in fact, europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel e class engines which mercedes-benz could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 e class.

       " 'i\\'ll say it up front, i don\\'t think edmunds does a consistent job on sedan reviews. i understand the whole \"they\\'re in bmw\\'s payroll\" thing as well as the \"but we\\'re not\" thing. this month\\'s letters to the editors & edmunds\\' responses make good points on both sides.unfortunately, edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared. i\\'m specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a tl-s edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition. the idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put bmw above the acura.is this happening? well, i decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out. given identical cars, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002. what, acura got slower or bmw got faster? given identical front seat toyota in 2001, now for 2002 bmw front seat toyota is tops while acura\\'s is bottom. did the seat actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?not that only acura gets the shaft either. in 2001 bmw got a higher \"feature content\" rating than the tl-s. in 2002, a 330i with more features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a tl-s with the same features. this in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash cd changer) were simply left off the top 10 features list in 2002, leaving bmw as a vehicle that offers every top 10 feature as either standard or optional.basically, i like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them. when i look at the rankings, though, they seem to be statistically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seat can change that much, then how can you rank these car based on 1% differences in the final rankings?in one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two car tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied. i suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two car after just one year.until then, i\\'m going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs. we spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2. if you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you\\'d think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.front seat comfort2001: acura 83, bmw 832002: bmw 9.2, acura 7.6rear seat comfort2001: bmw 74 acura 702002: acura 9.2 bmw 5.8conclusion: either bmw and acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results.

       " 'i saw the arguments about the tl and the 330. it is all about the buyer\\'s choice. i love my 03 bmw and i also love my 03 g35. they are imho exceptional car for the price i paid. i believe bmw handling can not be easily matched with a car in the same price range, except the corvette. g35 is also an excellent car and handles almost as good as the 330, i got the g because i didn\\'t want another bmw 3 series. the car is exceptional when it comes to performance and the looks, many people talk to me about the car in parking lots and gas stations. meanwhile an bmw is as we know m3.i recently test drove the tl (actually borrowed it from the dealer - manager is my friend) and there was so much hype about the car, so i got it for a couple of hours (their demo) drove around the town. and i was quite impressed, it is a way better car than the old tl. but the hype in my opinion is not well worth.the sound system works excellent if you actually have a dvd audio disc (they had one that was sent from the factory i think) and it is just excellent quality. but when you put a regular cd it is nothing ordinary. the performance, it has excellent pick up, but the fwd downgrades the potential of this car. whatever others say, there is the torque steer, this car would have been excellent as an rwd, and i think as far as the pick up (in street start the g will beat the tl, well we know bmw performance is something else)the interior is good quality but does not match the refinement of the bmw 3 series or the audi or the mb, but better than the g. the interior space was less than the g along with the trunk space. i guess the g is a larger car overall and that makes a lot of difference, especially for me with a family and lots of people in the car at all times. i think interior space is similar to 3 series sedan. i am 6\\'3\" and with my seating position there was almost no space at the back of the driver\\'s seat (a similarity to the 3 sedan)the handling of the car is not as refined as the 3 or the g. i realized this when i was entering a highway ramp at about 60-65 mph, and felt the need to hold the steering wheel with both hands very steady because the car almost got out of the road. it was a scary moment, and such wouldn\\'t happen with a rwd 3 series or the g or the audi audi. the handling is of course no issue in straight roads, but not everybody drives crazy like me in the backroads. i would prefer an audi quattro, 3 series or the g for backroads, mountain roads, but definitely not a tl. the car just didn\\'t make me feel comfortable enough, kind of made me scared in a couple of situations.the looks are not so much in my style, it feels so dull and very honda like. it doesn\\'t have a unique feeling of itself. i think they should have worked on the looks a little bit longer.overall the tl is an excellent value for an ordinary daily driver. it offers so much for so less, good interior, good performance, good safety features, and a low msrp.but for those who don\\'t mind spending the extra cash i know that many will opt for other vehicles. acura tl in my opinion is the choice for first time near-luxo car buyers who do not have the ability of spending another 5k without worrying about their pockets.i am looking forward to the new vette and most likely i will be the first in line to add the car into my garage. and then maybe trade in the g for the 05 audi audi quattro.meanwhile the argument of bmw is better than tl better than mb better than g better than this that can go on forever. but one need to know that everybody has a different budget, and different reason for buying a car. some people may not mind spending 40k, some people may only afford 34k some can not even afford that and some go out and buy a ferrari for 200k. instead of comparing i think it is best to drive the car and enjoy the purchase. i honestly did not see a ferrari owner and a lamborghini owner fighting and arguing about their car and try to prove one is better than the other.because they just don\\'t care much, they enjoy th ',\n",

       " 'think that\\'s a topic for another board, but i don\\'t think anyone can argue that v6 toyota or v6 honda (will refer to them as camcord from now on) give you best bang for buck. yes, you can get a lower brand car but the camcord is renowned for its reliability and low gas mileage and due to its reliability has a low total cost of ownership (tco).with respect to the price differential between a nav-accord and a nav-tl, i agree the nav-accord wins in the value equation, but from what i\\'ve read (somebody with more exp. with both systems please help me out) the acura\\'s nav system is a lot better. i have not bought any nav systems in my car to this point (i find a $20 map/atlas that i can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value) so i don\\'t know this for sure, but my understanding is that the nav system on the tl allows you to say \"phone home\" and then the car will dial the number for you, whereas this is not possible on the nav-equipped accord.now this may seem silly to you but i kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons:1) i never use a cell phone when driving (unless i\\'m stuck in traffic and need to tell someone i\\'ll be late) because it\\'s dangerous so to be able to make voice-activated calls is incredibly useful. time is money and if i can conduct some business while on the phone and save some time, the nav system on the tl could pay for itself. also, if you must talk on the phone, this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life, which is definitely worth something.2) one of my favorite shows as a kid was knight rider (in spite of david hasselhoff) because the talking chevrolet with the roving cylon eye was just so cool. there is a fun factor in talking to your car and getting a response back that is hard to quantify.3) if i buy the tl, it\\'ll be the infiniti so with a stick in right hand and wheel in left hand, voice-activated calling is really more than a luxury, it\\'s almost a necessity.the point is although objectively the nav-accord beats the nav-tl, i think there are some good reasons to spring the extra $ for the superior acura nav./voice system.with respect to the current generation v6 accords, i found that honda took all the driving fun out of the current gen. accord. to me, they have the driving feel of a toyota and frankly, the toyota is a better toyota than the honda is. when you compare prices on the non-nav honda v6 and non-nav tl, i think the price difference is only $3,700 (based on my market research that i could get the honda for $600 over invoice and the tl for $2k under msrp based on what\\'s been posted on the prices paid boards).i think the extra $3,700 is money well spent to upgrade from non-nav honda to non-nav tl. also, i really want a infiniti and unfortunately the honda sedan does not come in infiniti and v6. i\\'d have to get the honda infiniti v6 coupe.and my wife\\'s response when i suggested that we save some cash on my car by me getting the honda infiniti coupe was: \"i always sit in the front and you are responsible for putting son in the back seat and pulling him out of the back seat.\"well i like to save money like the next guy, but destroying my back is not the way i\\'m gonna do it so it\\'s the tl for me.

(you really appreciate irs when you are taking a nice sweeper fast and you hit a bump. when you lack irs the entire rear bounces up in the air and you say a silent prayer. not unlike torque steer!) today i had fun \"playing\" with my business fwd hyundai (v6, 5-speed manual with defeatable traction control) in the snow and ice. she tugs and pulls like crazy every time she loses traction. all that weight over the front wheels and those drive wheels trying to steer at the same time they fight for traction. you fight to steer her. just take a corner as you lose some front wheel traction. pulls left then right. laws of physics. that is true for every fwder i\\'ve ever driven hard. (and, yeah, i had fun driving \\'01 tl type s but she torque steered. same for the i35 sport i drove.) only way to go is to ensure the drive wheels are not the steering wheels! don\\'t forget that 5% of 3,000 pounds is 150 pounds. fwder is like having your pre-teen sitting on your hood all the time.

       " \"fwd vs rwd has been debated to death. my personal take is that the difference is overrated.mb makes rwd vehicles but how well do they handle? every mb i've ever driven has been a nice car but handling wasn not really its strongest characteristic.lexus makes both fwd and rwd cars, but aside from riez's favorite is300 (lol, he has 2 of 'em), i would really have to ford very hard to tell the difference in the drivetrain. a soft plushy ride completely divorced from any feel for the road sucks whether the drivetrain is a fwd or rwd.if you really want to make a performance car, you not only have to have the rwd but you need to do all the other things it takes to get the weight balance as close to 50-50. not sure what the exact weight balance on the is300 is riez, but it doesn't sound anywhere close to 50-50, so on that basis infiniti g35 and bmw are going to be a lot better than is300.also, i think if you are used to a rwd and then go to a fwd, the difference is really noticeable so you tend to overemphasize it. the opposite is also true.for example, i'm now used to my acura and when i had to drive an ml320, it took me a while to get used to the turns. once i got used to it in 5 mins. it was fine.i find that as long as i have some feel for the road, i can get used to just about any car and drive with my normal skill level, and after a while don't notice it unless i try to go above 7/10ths.living in the ne, i prefer fwd b/c i can slap on all seasons and not worry about snow tires. yes, you can get a rwd/awd sedan, but those are a lot heavier, so their performance is compromised and they eat up a lot more gas.when i move to ca, where bad weather isn't as much of a problem, i'd give a lot more consideration to rwd, but i'm not going to let the drivetrain alone influence my decision as to which car i want. \",\n",
